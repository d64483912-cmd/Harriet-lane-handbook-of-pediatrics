Preface
“Why this child? Why this disease? Why now?”
—Barton Childs, MD
The Harriet Lane Handbook was first developed in 1953 after Harrison 
Spencer (chief resident in 1950–1951) suggested that residents should 
write a pocket-­sized “pearl book.” As recounted by Henry Seidel, the first 
editor of The Harriet Lane Handbook, “Six of us began without funds and 
without [the] supervision of our elders, meeting sporadically around a table 
in the library of the Harriet Lane Home.” The product of their efforts was 
a concise yet comprehensive handbook that became an indispensable 
tool for the residents of the Harriet Lane Home. Ultimately, Robert Cooke 
(department chief, 1956–1974) realized the potential of the Handbook, 
and, with his backing, the fifth edition was published for widespread dis-
tribution by Year Book. Since that time, the handbook has been regularly 
updated and rigorously revised to reflect the most up-­to-­date information 
and available clinical guidelines. It has grown from a humble Hopkins 
resident “pearl book” to become a nationally and internationally respected 
clinical resource. Now translated into many languages, the handbook is still 
intended as an easy-­to-­use manual to help pediatricians provide current 
and comprehensive pediatric care.
Today, The Harriet Lane Handbook continues to be updated and 
revised by house officers for house officers. Recognizing the limit to what 
can be included in a pocket guide, additional information has been placed 
online and for use via mobile applications. The online-­only content includes 
references, expanded text, and additional tables, figures, and images.
In addition to including the most up-­to-­date guidelines, practice 
parameters, and references, we will highlight some of the most important 
improvements in the twenty-­second edition of The Harriet Lane Handbook:
The Emergency Management and Trauma, Burn, and Common Critical 
Care Emergencies chapters have been reorganized. The Emergency and 
Critical Care Management chapter now focuses on the medical manage-
ment of common critical care emergencies, while the management of 
trauma, including burns, has been consolidated into the Traumatic Injuries 
chapter.
The Development, Behavior, and Mental Health chapter has been 
separated into two chapters with expanded content: Behavior, Development, 
and Developmental Disability and Psychiatry, reflecting the growing need for 
pediatricians to understand mental and behavioral health.
The Genetics chapter has been reorganized to present categories of 
metabolic disease in easily referenced tables and to provide an organization 
to different patterns and etiologies of dysmorphology.
 

--- Page 10 ---
Preface    xi
The Hematology chapter has been restructured with much of the text 
re-­organized and expanded into tables and figures, including a new algo-
rithmic approach to anemia. Content on the management of transfusion 
reactions has been added.
The Immunoprophylaxis chapter includes a new section on vaccine 
hesitancy.
The Nutrition and Growth chapter now includes expanded content on 
the management of overweight and obese children, definitions of various 
degrees of malnutrition, information on refeeding syndrome, and a table 
with instructions on the preparation of fortified formula. Enteral formulas 
have been reorganized based on clinical indications.
The Radiology chapter has been reorganized with all-­new images and 
more focused content.
The Rheumatology chapter has been refocused for the general pediatri-
cian and includes a section on the primary care management of rheumato-
logic diseases.
The Harriet Lane Handbook, designed for pediatric house staff, was 
made possible by the extraordinary efforts of this year’s Johns Hopkins 
Harriet Lane Pediatric Residency Program senior resident class. It has 
been an honor to watch these fine doctors mature and refine their skills 
since internship. They have balanced their busy work schedules and per-
sonal lives while authoring the chapters that follow. We are grateful to each 
of them, along with their faculty advisors, who selflessly dedicated their 
time to improve the quality and content of this publication. The high quality 
of this handbook is representative of our residents, who are the heart and 
soul of our department.

The Formulary is complete, concise, and up-­to-­date thanks to the 
tireless efforts of Carlton K.K. Lee, PharmD, MPH. With each edition, he 
carefully updates, revises, and improves the section. His herculean efforts 
make the Formulary one of the most useful and cited pediatric drug  
reference texts available.
We are grateful and humbled to have the opportunity to build on the 
great work of the preceding editors: Drs. Henry Seidel, Harrison Spencer, 
William Friedman, Robert Haslam, Jerry Winkelstein, Herbert Swick, 
Dennis Headings, Kenneth Schuberth, Basil Zitelli, Jeffery Biller, Andrew 
Yeager, Cynthia Cole, Peter Rowe, Mary Greene, Kevin Johnson, Michael 
Barone, George Siberry, Robert Iannone, Veronica Gunn, Christian 
Nechyba, Jason Robertson, Nicole Shilkofski, Jason Custer, Rachel Rau, 
Megan Tschudy, Kristin Arcara, Jamie Flerlage, Branden Engorn, Helen 
Hughes, and Lauren Kahl. Many of these previous editors continue to 
make important contributions to the education of the Harriet Lane house 
staff, none more than Dr. Nicole Shilkofski, our current residency program 
director. We are constantly impressed by her enthusiasm for education and 
her advocacy for the residents. As recent editors, Drs. Helen Hughes and 
Lauren Kahl also have been instrumental in helping us to navigate this pro-
cess. We hope to live up to the legacy of these many outstanding clinicians, 
educators, and mentors.
An undertaking of this magnitude could not have been accomplished 
without the support and dedication of some extraordinary people. First, 
we would like to thank Dr. Janet Serwint, our residency program director 
during our first two years of residency. Thank you for entrusting us with the 
opportunity to serve as Chief Residents and Harriet Lane Handbook editors. 
We would also like to offer special thanks to Kathy Mainhart, an invaluable 
asset to our program. Without her guidance, we would all be lost. Thank 
you to Dequira Jones and Carly Hyde, the newest additions to our program 
staff. We are so appreciative of your support this past year. And last but 
certainly not least, thank you to our Department Director, Dr. Tina Cheng. 
We are so grateful for your mentorship and guidance­—we are honored to 
help shape the Children’s Center in your vision.

Chapter 1
Emergency and Critical Care 
Management
Kelsey Stayer, MD and Lisa Hutchins, PharmD
This chapter is presented in accordance with the universal acronym C-­A-­B 
(circulation, airway, breathing) to emphasize the reduction of “no blood 
flow” time.1-­3 However, given the high prevalence of asphyxial cardiac 
arrest in the pediatric population, ventilation remains fundamental to the 
resuscitation of the critically ill child.4 This chapter serves to function as a 
guide to caring for “sick” children, spanning the principles of resuscitation 
and stabilization, as well as management of the most common pediatric 
medical emergencies.
I.  APPROACH TO THE UNRESPONSIVE CHILD
A.  Circulation1-­3,5-­10
	1.	 Assessment
	
a.	 Pulse: Spend no more than 10 seconds assessing pulse. Assess 
brachial pulse in infants, carotid or femoral pulse in children.
	
b.	 Perfusion: Check for pallor, mottling, or cyanosis. Capillary refill time 
>2 seconds is delayed and <1 to 2 seconds or “flash” may indicate 
warm shock.
	
c.	 Rate: Bradycardia <60 beats/min with poor perfusion requires imme-
diate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Tachycardia >220 beats/
min suggests pathologic tachyarrhythmia.
	
d.	 Rhythm: Attach patient to defibrillator or continuous electrocardiogra-
phy. In arrest, check rhythm every 2 minutes with minimal interrup-
tions in chest compressions (e.g., during compressor change).
	
e.	 Blood pressure (BP): Hypotension in a pediatric patient is a late 
manifestation of circulatory compromise.
	
f.	 Urine output: Normal output is 1.5 to 2 mL/kg/h in infants and young 
children and 1 mL/kg/h in older children.
	2.	 Management: Initiate CPR immediately if patient is pulseless or brady-
cardic (<60 beats/min) with poor perfusion.
	
a.	 Chest compressions: See Box 1.1 for an outline of the five compo-
nents of high-­quality CPR.
	
b.	 Monitoring: Continuous capnography and invasive hemodynamic 
monitoring may guide effectiveness of chest compressions.
	
(1)	 Target end-­tidal CO2 (EtCO2) >20 mmHg. If consistently less than, 
improve compressions and assess for excessive ventilation.
	
(2)	 Abrupt and sustained rise in EtCO2 is often observed just prior to 
clinical return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).
 

--- Page 17 ---
4    Part I  Pediatric Acute Care
	
(3)	 If a patient has an indwelling arterial catheter, assess waveform 
for feedback to evaluate chest compressions. Target diastolic BP 
>25 mmHg in infants and >30 mmHg in children.
	
c.	 Defibrillation: Shockable arrest rhythms include ventricular fibrillation 
and pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Nonshockable arrest rhythms 
include asystole, pulseless electrical activity, and bradycardia with 
poor perfusion.
	
(1)	 Use age-­ and size-­appropriate pads as recommended per 
manufacturer.
	
(2)	 Initial shock dose is 2 J/kg, second dose is 4 J/kg, subsequent 
doses are ≥4 J/kg (maximum 10 J/kg or adult maximum dose).
	
d.	 Cardioversion: A synchronized electrical shock delivered for hemody-
namically unstable patients with tachyarrhythmias (i.e., supraventricular 
tachycardia, atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia) and palpable pulses.
	
(1)	 Initial dose is 0.5 to 1 J/kg. Increase to 2 J/kg if ineffective, 
repeating doses if necessary. Reevaluate diagnosis if rhythm does 
not convert to sinus.
	
(2)	 Consultation with a pediatric cardiologist is recommended for 
elective cardioversion for stable patients with tachyarrhythmias.
	
e.	 Resuscitation
	
(1)	 Access: Place intraosseous access immediately if in arrest or if 
intravenous (IV) access difficult.
BOX 1.1
FIVE COMPONENTS OF HIGH-­QUALITY CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION
• “Push fast”: Target rate of 100–120 compressions/min
• “Push hard”: Target depth of at least ⅓ anteroposterior diameter of chest
 
• 
Place step stool at side of bed to assist compressor
 
• 
Slide backboard under patient or place on hard surface
 
• 
Use the compression technique that achieves the best results 
 
• 
Consider two-­handed, one-­handed, two-­finger, or two-­thumb-­
encircling hands techniques
 
• 
Aim for 1 fingerbreadth below intermammary line in infants, 2 finger-
breadths in prepubertal children, and the lower half of the sternum in 
adolescents
• Allow full chest recoil between compressions
• Minimize interruptions in chest compressions
 
• 
Rotate compressor every 2 min or sooner if fatigued
 
• 
Check cardiac rhythm at time of compressor change
• 
Avoid excessive ventilation
 
• 
If no advanced airway (endotracheal tube, laryngeal mask airway, trache-
ostomy) secured, perform 30:2 compression-­ventilation ratio (with single 
rescuer or for any adolescent/adult) or 15:2 ratio (in an infant/child only if 2 
rescuers present)
 
• 
If advanced airway secured, give one breath every 6–8 sec with continu-
ous compressions
 
• 
Ventilation volume should produce no more than minimal, visible chest rise

(a)	 If previously established, central access is preferred for drug 
administration.
	
(b)	 Endotracheal tube (ETT) drug administration is acceptable 
if required. Lidocaine, epinephrine, atropine, and naloxone 
(LEAN) and vasopressin can be administered via endotracheal 
route.
	
(2)	 Pharmacotherapy: See Table 1.1 detailing medications for 
pediatric resuscitation. If actual body weight is unavailable, use 
length-­based habitus-­modified (e.g., Mercy method, PAWPER 
tape) estimation methods, parental estimates, or length-­based 
(e.g., Broselow tape) estimation methods, in order of accuracy.
	
(3)	 Fluids: Administer isotonic crystalloid for treatment of shock even 
if BP is normal.
	
(a)	 Administer up to 60 mL/kg of isotonic crystalloid in 20 mL/kg 
increments in non-neonates during the first 20 minutes until 
perfusion improves. Frequently reassess for hepatomegaly, 
pulmonary crackles, and respiratory distress.
	
(b)	 Special consideration for cardiogenic shock:
	
(i)	 Administer an initial fluid bolus of 5 to 10 mL/kg over 
10 to 20 minutes if cardiac insufficiency suspected or 
unknown (consider in neonate).
	
(ii)	 Be prepared to support oxygenation and ventilation in 
case of pulmonary edema.
	
(c)	 Special consideration for septic shock: Specific goals of 
therapy include ScvO2 (central venous saturation) ≥70%, 
adequate BP, normalized heart rate (HR), and appropriate 
end-­organ perfusion.
	
f.	 Extracorporeal-CPR (E-­CPR): Rapid deployment of venoarterial (VA) 
or venovenous (VV) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) 
to artificially provide oxygenation, ventilation, and circulation as a 
means of CPR for in-­hospital arrest refractory to conventional inter-
ventions. Contraindications are limited but may include extremes of 
prematurity or low birth weight, lethal chromosomal abnormalities, 
uncontrollable hemorrhage, or irreversible brain damage. Should not 
be offered if likely to be futile. 
B.  Airway and Breathing1,7,11-­17
	1.	 Assessment
	
a.	 Airway patency: Perform head tilt and chin lift or jaw thrust to open 
airway. Avoid overextension in infants.
	
b.	 Spontaneous respirations: Assess spontaneous patient effort.
	
(1)	 If breathing regularly, place patient in recovery position (turn onto 
side).
	
(2)	 If the patient has a palpable pulse but inadequate breathing, 
provide a 1-­second breath every 3 to 5 seconds.
	
c.	 Adequacy of respiration: Evaluate for symmetric chest rise. Auscultate 
for equal breath sounds with good aeration.

d.	 Distress: Recognize tachypnea, grunting, flaring, retractions, stridor, 
or wheeze. Infants may exhibit head bobbing.
	2.	 Securing airway
	
a.	 Bag-­mask ventilation (BVM): May be used indefinitely if ventilating 
effectively.
	
(1)	 Avoid pushing mask down, which can obstruct airway. Bring face 
into mask.
	
(2)	 Consider oropharyngeal airway in the unconscious patient with 
obstruction. Correct size will extend from corner of mouth to 
mandibular angle.
	
(3)	 Consider nasopharyngeal airway in the conscious (gag reflex 
intact) or unconscious patient with obstruction. Correct size will 
extend from tip of nose to tragus of ear.
	
(4)	 Cricoid pressure (Sellick maneuver) may be used to minimize 
gastric inflation and aspiration. Avoid excess pressure leading to 
tracheal obstruction.
	
b.	 Laryngeal mask airway (LMA): Supraglottic airway placed blindly. 
Useful to emergently secure access to a difficult airway.
	
(1)	 Use manufacturer-­specific weight-­based mask size estimation 
systems or the combined width of the patient’s index, middle, 
and ring fingers to estimate mask size.
	
(2)	 Continuous chest compressions can be performed once LMA is 
placed.
	
c.	 Endotracheal intubation: Rapid sequence intubation is indicated 
in patients presenting with (presumed) full stomach. Immediately 
sequential sedation and neuromuscular blockade help to avert the 
need for positive pressure ventilation, minimizing aspiration risk.
	
(1)	 Preparation: Always have a secondary plan to manage the airway 
if intubation is unsuccessful.
	
(a)	 Preoxygenation: Deliver 100% oxygen via a nonrebreather 
mask for at least 3 minutes. Children have higher oxygen 
consumption than adults and can rapidly become hypoxemic.
	
(b)	 Equipment: Collect monitoring, suctioning, and oxygen deliv-
ery equipment.
	
(i)	 If available, quantitative EtCO2 is recommended as pri-
mary method to confirm ventilation.
	
(ii)	 Place suction catheter at head of bed. Set suction device 
from −80 mmHg to −120 mmHg.
	
(iii)	Consider nasogastric tube for stomach decompression. 
See Chapter 4 for placement.
	
(c)	 Airway supplies: Both cuffed and uncuffed ETTs are accept-
able. Cuffed tubes may decrease risk of aspiration.
	
(i)	 If available, use a length-­based estimator (e.g., Broselow 
tape) of ETT size and laryngoscope blade size.
	
(ii)	 To estimate age-­based ETT size (internal diameter) for 
patients 2 to 10 years:
 

--- Page 22 ---
Chapter 1  Emergency and Critical Care Management    9
1
	
 	

	
Cuffed ETT  (mm)   =   (age in years / 4)   +  3.5
Uncuffed ETT  (mm)   =   (age in years / 4)   +  4.0	
	
(iii)	To approximate depth of insertion:
	
Depth  (mm)   =  ETT size  (mm) ×3	
	
(iv)	Choose laryngoscope blade type and size based on 
patient age and airway.
	
(v)	 Straight (i.e., Miller) blades are typically reserved for 
children <2 years age or difficult airways.
	
[1]	Miller #00-­1 for premature to 2 months age
	
[2]	Miller #1 for 3 months to 3 years age
	
[3]	Miller #2 for >3 years age
	
(vi)	Curved (i.e., Mac) laryngoscope blades are often more 
effective for children >2 years age.
	
[1]	Mac #2 for >2 years age
	
[2]	Mac #3 for >8 years age
	
(d)	 Pharmacology: See Table 1.2 for rapid sequence intubation 
medications.
	
(e)	 Positioning: Place patient in “sniffing” position with neck 
slightly extended to align the airway.
	
(i)	 Infants and toddlers may require towel roll beneath shoul-
ders due to large occiput.
	
(ii)	 Children and adolescents may require towel roll beneath 
neck.
	
(2)	 Procedure: Advanced airways should be placed by experienced 
healthcare providers with appropriate training.
	
(a)	 Confirm placement by detecting EtCO2, observing chest wall 
movement, auscultating for symmetric breath sounds, and 
monitoring oxygen saturation. Evaluate placement via chest 
radiograph.
	
(3)	 Failure: Acute respiratory failure in an intubated patient may 
signify Displacement of the ETT, Obstruction, Pneumothorax, or 
Equipment failure (DOPE).
	
d.	 Surgical airway: Consider needle or surgical cricothyrotomy if BVM, 
endotracheal intubation, and LMA fail. If available, consult emer-
gently with difficult airway specialists (pediatric anesthesiologist, 
intensivist, and/or otolaryngologist).
	3.	 Oxygenation and Ventilation
	
a.	 Oxygen delivery systems:
	
(1)	 Low-­flow systems (e.g., nasal cannula, simple face mask) do not 
meet the inspiratory flow demand of the patient. Delivery of set 
fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is difficult due to room air mixing.
	
(2)	 High-­flow systems (e.g., nonrebreather, oxygen hood) do meet 
the inspiratory flow demand of the patient. Measurable FiO2 is 
delivered.

for infants and toddlers, 30 L/min for children, and up to 50 
L/min for adolescents and adults.
	
b.	 Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV):
	
(1)	 CPAP: Delivery of a continuous, distending positive airway pres-
sure independent of patient inspiratory effort.
	
(2)	 BiPAP: Pressure-­limited ventilatory mode in which the clinician 
sets an inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) and expiratory 
positive airway pressure (EPAP).
	
(a)	 EPAP is started at 4 to 5 cmH2O and increased to a maxi-
mum of 8 to 12 cmH2O.
	
(b)	 Set 4 to 6 cmH2O of pressure support, or the difference 
between IPAP and EPAP.
	
(c)	 Consider setting a “backup rate,” or respiratory rate just shy 
of the spontaneous respiratory rate to be delivered in case of 
apnea.
	
c.	 Mechanical Ventilation:
	
(1)	 Parameters:
	
(a)	 Rate: Number of mechanical breaths delivered per minute.
	
(b)	 FiO2: Fraction of oxygen in inspired gas.
	
(c)	 PIP: Peak inspiratory pressure attained during respiratory 
cycle.
	
(d)	 Positive end-­expiratory pressure (PEEP): Distending pressure 
that increases functional residual capacity (FRC), or volume 
of gas at the end of exhalation.
	
(e)	 Mean airway pressure (Paw): Average airway pressure over 
entire respiratory cycle, which correlates to mean alveolar 
volume.
	
(f)	 Tidal volume (VT): Volume of gas delivered during inspiration.
	
(g)	 Time: May indicate a function of time spent in inspiration (Ti), 
in high pressure (Thigh), or in low pressure (Tlow).
	
(2)	 Modes of Ventilation:
	
(a)	 Controlled Ventilation: Ventilation is completely mechanical with 
no spontaneous ventilation efforts expected from the patient.
	
(i)	 Pressure-­controlled ventilation (PCV): A preset respira-
tory rate and Ti delivers a pressure-­limited breath (the set 
pressure is maintained during inspiration). VT is deter-
mined by the preset pressure as well as lung compliance 
and resistance.
	
(ii)	 Volume-­controlled ventilation (VCV): A preset respiratory 
rate and Ti delivers a preset VT.

Chapter 1  Emergency and Critical Care Management    13
1
	
(b)	 Intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV): Allows the patient to 
breathe spontaneously between a preset number of (manda-
tory) mechanical breaths.
	
(i)	 Synchronized IMV (SIMV): If patient initiates spontaneous 
breath, mandatory breath is synchronized with patient 
effort rather than spaced evenly over each minute.
	
(ii)	 If spontaneous breathing rate is less than mandatory rate, 
some mandatory breaths will be delivered in the absence 
of patient effort.
	
(iii)	Delivered breaths may be volume regulated or pressure 
limited.
	
(c)	 Airway-­pressure-­release ventilation (APRV): Most of the 
respiratory cycle is spent at a high distending pressure (a 
functionally high CPAP phase) with intermittent, short release 
to a low pressure for a brief ventilation phase. Spontaneous 
breathing can be superimposed at any point in the cycle.
	
(d)	 Support ventilation: Mechanical breaths support patient-­
initiated breaths, but no mandatory breaths are provided.
	
(i)	 Pressure support (PS): Delivers a preset amount of pres-
sure to assist spontaneous respiratory effort.
	
(ii)	 Often used in combination with other modes of ventila-
tion to support spontaneous breaths greater than preset 
respiratory rates.
	
(e)	 High-­frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV): Gas flow pres-
surizes the system to the preset Paw while a piston moves 
backwards and forwards to force and withdraw a small VT 
(that approximates anatomic dead space) into the lungs at 
rates exceeding normal respiratory rates.
	
(3)	 Management: The three subdivisions of mechanical ventilatory 
support are the acute (lung recruitment), maintenance (lung 
recovery), and weaning phases.
	
(a)	 Acute: See Table 1.3 for ventilation parameter initial settings 
and titration effects.
	
(b)	 Maintenance: To avoid volutrauma, barotrauma, or oxygen 
toxicity, maintain VT at 4-­6 mL/kg, PIP < 35 cmH2O, and FiO2 
≤ 60%.
	
(c)	 Weaning:
	
(i)	 Assess daily for clinical signs of readiness, such as spon-
taneous breathing efforts.
	
(ii)	 Standard indices indicating readiness include: FiO2 
<50%, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, PIP <20 cmH2O, normalized 
rate for age, and absence of hypercapnia or acidosis.
	
(iii)	The general approach combines gradual weaning of 
parameters and reliance on pressure-­support modes.
	
(d)	 Extubation:
	
(i)	 Provide humidified inspired oxygen after extubation.
 

--- Page 27 ---
14    Part I  Pediatric Acute Care
	
(ii)	 In case of uncuffed tube or the absence of an air leak 
at delivered pressure <30 cmH2O, consider 24 hours 
of dexamethasone (airway edema dosing) to prevent 
postextubation stridor. 
II.  MANAGEMENT OF SHOCK3,5,7,11
A.  Definition: Physiologic state characterized by inadequate oxygen 
and nutrient delivery to meet tissue demands
	1.	 Compensated: Perfusion to vital organs is maintained by compensatory 
mechanisms.
	
a.	 Tachycardia is often the first and most sensitive vital sign change.
	
b.	 Blood flow is redirected from nonvital organs and tissues to vital 
organs by a selective increase in systemic vascular resistance (SVR), 
resulting in reduced peripheral perfusion and decreased urine 
volume.
	
c.	 Cardiac contractility increases to maintain cardiac output.
	
d.	 Increased venous smooth muscle tone improves preload and stroke 
volume.
	2.	 Decompensated: Perfusion to vital organs is compromised. Denoted 
by hypotension, poor perfusion, oliguria/anuria, and altered mental 
status.

B.  Etiology: Categorized into four basic types:
	1.	 Hypovolemic: inadequate fluid intake, increased fluid losses (hemor-
rhage, gastroenteritis, burns). Assess for tachycardia, narrow pulse 
pressure, delayed capillary refill, cool extremities.
	2.	 Cardiogenic: congenital heart disease, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, 
arrhythmia. Assess for increased respiratory effort from pulmonary 
edema, hepatomegaly, jugular venous distension, and cyanosis.
	3.	 Distributive: sepsis, anaphylaxis, neurogenic (e.g., high cervical spine 
injury)
	
a.	 Assess for tachycardia, fever, and petechial, purpuric, or urticarial 
rash.
	
b.	 Warm septic shock is characterized by bounding peripheral pulses, 
flash capillary refill, and wide pulse pressure.
	
c.	 Cold septic shock is characterized by decreased peripheral pulses, 
delayed capillary refill, and narrow pulse pressure.
	
d.	 Neurogenic shock is characterized by hypotension with a wide pulse 
pressure, normal HR or bradycardia, and hypothermia.
	4.	 Obstructive: tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, pulmonary 
embolism, ductal-­dependent congenital cardiac abnormalities
	
a.	 Early clinical presentation is indistinguishable from hypovolemic 
shock. Progression of shock leads to signs and symptoms similar to 
cardiogenic shock.
	
b.	 Cardiac tamponade is characterized by muffled heart sounds and 
pulsus paradoxus.
	
c.	 Ductal-­dependent lesions may be characterized by higher preductal 
versus postductal BP or arterial oxygen saturation. 
C.  Management
	1.	 Administer 100% supplemental oxygen initially regardless of oxygen 
saturation to optimize oxygen delivery. Once perfusion restored, titrate 
as able to avoid adverse effects from hyperoxia.
	2.	 See Table 1.4 for type-­ and etiology-­specific pathophysiology and man-
agement of shock.
	3.	 See Table 1.5 for vasoactive agents to support cardiac output. Vasoactive 
agents affect SVR (vasodilators and vasoconstrictors), cardiac contractil-
ity (inotropes), or HR (chronotropes). Some agents increase blood flow 
via contractility and vasodilation (inodilators) or increase perfusion pres-
sure via contractility and vasoconstriction (inoconstrictors). 
III.  MANAGEMENT OF COMMON EMERGENCIES
A.  Anaphylaxis18
	1.	 Definition: Rapid-­onset (minutes to hours) usually immunoglobulin 
E (IgE)-­mediated systemic allergic reaction involving multiple organ 
systems, including two or more of the following:
	
a.	 Cutaneous/mucosal (80% to 90%): flushing, urticaria, pruritis, 
angioedema

b.	 Respiratory (70%): laryngeal edema, bronchospasm, dyspnea, 
wheezing, stridor, hypoxemia
	
c.	 Gastrointestinal (45%): vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, crampy abdomi-
nal pain
	
d.	 Circulatory (45%): tachycardia, hypotension, syncope
	2.	 Management:
	
a.	 Stop exposure to precipitating antigen.
	
b.	 While performing A-­B-­Cs, immediately give intramuscular (IM) epi-
nephrine into midanterolateral thigh.
	
(1)	 For child, administer 0.01 mg/kg of 1 mg/mL solution up to a max 
dose of 1 mg/dose. For adult-­sized patients, first administer 0.2 
to 0.5 mg of 1 mg/mL solution, increasing as necessary up to max 
single dose of 1 mg.
	
(2)	 Autoinjector dosing: 7.5 to <15 kg use 0.1 mg, 15 to <30 kg use 
0.15 mg, ≥30 kg use 0.3 mg.
	
(3)	 Repeat dosing every 5 to 15 minutes as needed.
	
c.	 Provide oxygen and ventilatory assistance. Consider early endotra-
cheal intubation.
	
d.	 Obtain IV access. For management of shock, resuscitate with 20 mL/
kg isotonic crystalloid fluid boluses and vasoactive agents as needed.
	
e.	 Place patient in Trendelenburg position (head 30 degrees below 
feet).
	
f.	 Consider adjuvant pharmacologic agents:
	
(1)	 Histamine receptor antagonist: Diphenhydramine (H1-­
antagonism) and ranitidine/famotidine (H2-­antagonism)
	
(2)	 Corticosteroid: Methylprednisolone or dexamethasone
	
(3)	 Inhaled β2 agonist: Albuterol
	
g.	 Symptoms may recur (“biphasic anaphylaxis”) up to 72 hours after 
initial recovery.
	
(1)	 Observe for a minimum of 4 to 10 hours for late-­phase symptoms.
	
(2)	 Discharge with an epinephrine autoinjector and an anaphylaxis 
action plan. 
B.  Upper Airway Obstruction
	1.	 Epiglottitis19-­20
	
a.	 Definition: Life-­threatening, rapidly progressive inflammation (usually 
infectious) of the supraglottic region.
	
(1)	 Most often affects children between 1 and 7 years, but may 
occur at any age.
	
(2)	 May be caused by infection, thermal injury, caustic ingestion, or 
foreign body.
	
(3)	 Most common infectious organisms include Haemophilus 
influenzae (unvaccinated), Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A 
streptococci, and Staphylococcus aureus.
	
(4)	 Patients often present febrile, toxic-­appearing, and tripoding in 
respiratory distress. Drooling, dysphagia and inspiratory stridor 
are common. Barky cough is absent.
 

--- Page 32 ---
Chapter 1  Emergency and Critical Care Management    19

b.	 Management: Avoid any agitation of the child prior to securing airway 
to prevent impending complete obstruction.
	
(1)	 Allow child to assume a position of comfort. Unobtrusively provide 
blow-­by oxygen. Monitor with pulse oximetry.
	
(2)	 To secure airway, emergently consult difficult airway personnel 
(pediatric anesthesiologist, intensivist, and/or otolaryngologist).
	
(a)	 If unstable (unresponsive, cyanotic, bradycardic), emergently 
intubate.
	
(b)	 If stable with high suspicion, escort patient to OR for laryn-
goscopy and intubation under general anesthesia. Equipment 
for tracheotomy should be readily available.
	
(c)	 If stable with moderate or low suspicion, obtain lateral 
neck radiograph to assess for “thumb sign” of an inflamed 
epiglottis.
	
(3)	 Initiate broad-­spectrum antibiotic therapy (e.g., vancomycin and 
Ceftriaxone).
	2.	 Croup21-­22
	
a.	 Definition: Common infectious inflammation of the subglottic area.
	
(1)	 Most common in infants aged 6 to 36 months.
	
(2)	 75% of infections are caused by parainfluenza virus.
	
(3)	 Patients present with fever, barking cough, inspiratory stridor, and 
increased work of breathing, often worse at night.
	
b.	 Management:
	
(1)	 Administer oxygen to children with hypoxemia or severe respira-
tory distress. Consider humidified air, although current consensus 
suggests it is ineffective for mild to moderate disease.
	
(2)	 If no stridor at rest, give dexamethasone. Consider nebulized 
budesonide in patients vomiting or who lack IV access.
	
(3)	 If stridor at rest, give dexamethasone and nebulized racemic epi-
nephrine. Observe for 2 to 4 hours given short duration of action 
of nebulized epinephrine.
	
(4)	 Indications for hospitalization include >1 racemic epinephrine 
nebulization required, atypical age (<6 months), severe respira-
tory distress, or dehydration.
	
(5)	 Consider heliox (helium and oxygen mixture) to improve tur-
bulent airflow in moderate to severe croup, although benefit is 
controversial.
	3.	 Foreign body aspiration1,20,23
	
a.	 Definition: Acute airway obstruction from aspiration of an organic 
(e.g., nuts, seeds, grapes, hot dogs) or inorganic (e.g., coins, pins, 
beads, balloons, small toy parts) foreign body.
	
(1)	 Male children younger than 3 years of age are most susceptible.
	
(2)	 Patients (<40%) present with classic triad of paroxysmal cough, 
wheezing, and decreased air entry. Other manifestations include 
cyanosis, fever, stridor, and persistent pneumonia or notably may 
be asymptomatic.
 

--- Page 33 ---
20    Part I  Pediatric Acute Care
	
(3)	 The most common location is the right main bronchus (45% to 
57%), then left main bronchus (18% to 40%), and trachea (10% 
to 17%).
	
b.	 Management: Care is taken to avoid converting a partial airway 
obstruction into complete obstruction.
	
(1)	 If not breathing (no cough or sound):
	
(a)	 Infant: Deliver repeated cycles of 5 back blows followed by 5 
chest compressions until object is expelled or victim becomes 
unresponsive.
	
(b)	 Child: Perform subdiaphragmatic abdominal thrusts 
(Heimlich maneuver) until object is expelled or victim 
becomes unresponsive.
	
(c)	 Patients should be taken to the OR for emergent removal 
under direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy.
	
(2)	 If breathing (forcefully coughing, phonating):
	
(a)	 Obtain posteroranterior chest (including neck) radiograph 
to screen for radiopaque body or mediastinal shift. Consider 
inspiratory and expiratory films (or bilateral lateral decubitus 
in young patients) to assess for air trapping. A normal chest 
radiograph does not rule out foreign body.
	
(b)	 If clinical concern is high, consider urgent bronchoscopy or 
laryngoscopy.
	
(3)	 If patient becomes unresponsive: initiate CPR immediately.
	
(a)	 After 30 chest compressions, open airway and remove foreign 
body if visible. Do not perform blind sweep.
	
(b)	 Attempt to give two breaths and continue with cycles of chest 
compressions and ventilations until object expelled. 
C.  Status Asthmaticus24-­28
	1.	 Definition: Inflammatory airflow obstruction secondary to triad of airway 
edema, bronchoconstriction, and hyperresponsiveness.
	2.	 Examination: Assess breathlessness, speech, alertness, respiratory rate, 
accessory muscle use, wheezing, HR, pulsus paradoxus, peak expira-
tory flow, SpO2, and pCO2.
	3.	 Management:
	
a.	 Provide oxygen to achieve SpO2 ≥90%. If hypoxemia not readily cor-
rected with supplemental oxygen, consider pneumothorax, pneumo-
nia, methemoglobinemia, or other process.
	
b.	 See Table 1.6 for pharmacologic agents used in acute asthma 
exacerbations.
	
c.	 Ventilation interventions:
	
(1)	 Normalizing pCO2 can be a sign of impending respiratory 
failure.
	
(2)	 NIPPV (e.g., BiPAP) may be used in patients with impending 
respiratory failure to avoid intubation but requires a cooperative 
patient with spontaneous respirations.

(3)	 Intubation should be approached cautiously given the risk of 
worsening air-­trapping and difficulty in managing the transition 
from extremely negative to positive pressure ventilation.
	
(a)	 Indications include severe airway obstruction, markedly 
increased work of breathing, refractory hypoxemia, and 
impending respiratory arrest.
	
(b)	 Ventilation strategies include slower rates with prolonged expi-
ratory phase, minimal end-­expiratory pressures, and short 
inspiratory times to minimize hyperinflation and air trapping.

b.	 A pulmonary hypertensive crisis is a sudden increase in PAP and 
pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) that causes acute right-­sided 
heart failure.
	
(1)	 May be triggered by pain, anxiety, tracheal suctioning, hypoxia, 
acidosis, or respiratory illness. Most commonly described after 
cardiac surgery or in the setting of rapid withdrawal of PH-­
specific therapies.
	
(2)	 Patients present with systemic hypotension, oxygen desatu-
ration (if atrial or ventricular communication present), and 
decreased EtCO2 on capnography (reduced pulmonary blood 
flow).
	
(3)	 Assess for increased intensity of systolic murmur (worsening 
tricuspid regurgitation) and increased hepatomegaly.
	2.	 Management: Timely consultation with providers with expertise in man-
aging PH is recommended.
	
a.	 Implement efforts to keep patient calm. Consider opiates, sedatives, 
and neuromuscular blockade to reduce stress response, especially 
postoperatively. Avoid agents that decrease SVR.
	
b.	 Administer supplemental oxygen to treat hypoxemia or as an adjunct 
to pulmonary vasodilators.
	
c.	 Avoid acute hypercarbia and acidosis, which abruptly increase 
PVR. Consider brief hyperventilation or sodium bicarbonate 
infusions.
	
d.	 Diuretics treat congestive symptoms. Avoid excessive reduction in 
intravascular volume leading to decreased cardiac output.
	
e.	 NIPPV may improve oxygenation, treat hypoventilation, and reduce 
work of breathing. Weigh benefits against increasing patient anxiety 
and delaying mechanical ventilation.
	
f.	 PH-­specific pharmacologic therapies aim to induce pulmonary vaso-
dilation, support the right ventricle, and maintain cardiac output.
	
(1)	 Inhaled pulmonary vasodilators: Nitric oxide
	
(a)	 Indicated to reduce need for ECMO in patients with an oxy-
gen index >25.
	
(b)	 Rapid withdrawal of low doses may cause rebound PH. 
Gradually decrease dose when weaning.
	
(c)	 Monitor for methemoglobinemia.
	
(2)	 Phosphodiesterase type-­5 inhibitors: Sildenafil, tadalafil
	
(a)	 Often used to prevent rebound PH associated with cessation 
of nitric oxide.
	
(b)	 Monitor for acute hypotension or hypoxemia secondary to 
increased alveolar-­arterial gradient.
	
(3)	 Synthetic prostacyclin analogs: Epoprostenol (Flolan), treprostinil, 
iloprost
	
(4)	 Endothelin receptor antagonist: Bosentan
	
g.	 Consider ECMO or emergent atrial septostomy in case of failed medi-
cal management.

E.  Hypertensive Crisis11,30
	1.	 Definition:
	
a.	 For normal BP values based on age and height, see Chapter 7.
	
b.	 Hypertensive emergency: Acutely elevated BP (usually significantly 
>99th percentile for age and gender) with evidence of end-­organ 
damage.
	
(1)	 Most commonly secondary to renal disease, catecholamine-­
producing tumors, endocrine syndromes, toxidromes, medication 
withdrawal, or elevated intracranial pressure (ICP).
	
(2)	 Presents with encephalopathy (e.g., headaches, vomiting, sei-
zures, altered mental status), vision disturbance, congestive heart 
failure (e.g., dyspnea, peripheral edema, gallop rhythm), and 
acute kidney injury.
	
c.	 Hypertensive urgency: Acutely elevated BP (usually >5 mmHg greater 
than the 99th percentile for age and gender) without evidence of 
end-­organ damage.
	
(1)	 Most commonly primary hypertension in children >7 years age, 
followed by renal disease.
	
(2)	 Present with minor complaints (e.g., headaches, nausea).
	2.	 Management:
	
a.	 Rule out increased ICP before instituting antihypertensive treatment 
given critical need to maintain cerebral perfusion.
	
b.	 Goal is to reduce BP by ≤25% in the first 8 hours, then gradual 
normalization over the next 24 to 48 hours.
	
c.	 See Table 1.7 for hypertensive emergency and urgency medications. 
F.  Hypercyanotic Crisis (“Tet spell”)20,31
	1.	 Definition: Cyanotic emergency secondary to an acute worsening of a 
preexisting right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (e.g., in a patient 
with tetralogy of Fallot) that prevents pulmonary blood flow and induces 
a right-­to-­left intracardiac shunt.
	
a.	 Peak incidence occurs between 2 and 4 months of age.
	
b.	 Usually occurs in the morning after crying, feeding, or defecation.
	
c.	 Patients present with extreme cyanosis, hyperpnea, tachypnea, and 
agitation.
	2.	 Management: Follow stepwise approach, escalating if spell is not 
broken.
	
a.	 Make every effort to calm the child. Allow parent to comfort. Consider 
oral sucrose analgesia (e.g., Sweet-­Ease).
	
b.	 Bring knees to chest in infants or encourage squatting in older chil-
dren to increase SVR and decrease shunting.
	
c.	 Administer 100% oxygen if patient tolerates, although effect is lim-
ited given absence of effective pulmonary blood flow.
	
d.	 For stepwise pharmacologic abortive management, see Table 1.8.
	
e.	 Consider isotonic crystalloid resuscitation (5 to 10 mL/kg boluses) to 
ensure adequate preload if patient is dehydrated.

gery for palliation with a systemic to pulmonary shunt or full repair. 
G.  Altered Level of Consciousness20,32
	1.	 Definition: A spectrum of impaired consciousness spanning confusion, 
disorientation, agitation, stupor, lethargy, and coma.
	
a.	 Fluctuations in level of consciousness are common and progression 
may occur rapidly.
	
b.	 Coma: Refers to an unarousable state.
	
c.	 Lethargy: Refers to a depressed consciousness resembling sleep 
from which a patient can be aroused but immediately returns to 
depressed state.
	
d.	 Stupor: Refers to a state of depressed responses to external stimuli 
but not totally asleep.
	
e.	 Standard descriptors of level of responsiveness include:
	
(1)	 The Glasgow Coma Scale (and modified scale for infants): See 
Table 1.9 to score level of responsiveness.
	
(2)	 AVPU mnemonic: Graded as A if alert, V if responsive to verbal 
stimulation, P if responsive to painful stimulation, or U if 
unresponsive.
	
f.	 Broad differential considerations include Drugs, Infection, Metabolic, 
and Structural causes (DIMS).
	
g.	 See Table 1.10 for common etiologies and targeted work-­up 
recommendations.
	2.	 Management: Stabilize initially. Further management is aimed at correct-
ing underlying etiology.
	
a.	 Airway, Breathing, Circulation:
	
(1)	 Administer supplemental oxygen to patients presenting with sei-
zure or with signs of shock, regardless of pulse oximetry reading.
	
(2)	 Intubation is indicated in patients unable to protect their airway.
	
(3)	 Consider delaying administration of atropine unless necessary 
secondary to the loss of pupillary light reflex.

(4)	 Avoid hypercarbia, maintaining PaCO2 in normal range. 
Prophylactic hyperventilation is not recommended.
	
b.	 Dextrose: Correct hypoglycemia immediately with a 5 to 10 mL/kg 
bolus of 10% dextrose or 2 to 4 mL/kg of 25% dextrose. After bolus, 
start a continuous infusion of dextrose-­containing fluids to avoid 
recurrent hypoglycemia.
	
c.	 Imaging: Request emergency head computed tomography (CT) 
if patient stable for transport. Consult with neurosurgical team if 
indicated.
	
d.	 Hyponatremia: Often asymptomatic unless sodium decreases rapidly 
or becomes severe (i.e., <125 mmol/L).
	
(1)	 Treat symptomatic hyponatremia immediately with a 3 to 5 mL/kg 
bolus of 3% hypertonic saline over 15 to 30 minutes until seizure 
activity ceases or serum sodium level is >125 mmol/L.
	
(2)	 See Chapter 11 for subsequent, slow correction of asymptomatic 
hyponatremia.
	
e.	 Infection: If presentation concerning for severe sepsis, treat empiri-
cally with broad-­spectrum antibiotics (e.g., ceftriaxone and vanco-
mycin) within the first hour. Include antiviral therapy (e.g., acyclovir) 
if viral encephalitis is suspected. Lumbar puncture should be 
performed only if there is no clinical suspicion of increased ICP and 
the patient is stable.

I.  Increased Intracranial Pressure35-­37
	1.	 Definition: An increase in the volume of an intracranial component 
(brain, blood, or cerebrospinal fluid) within the fixed volume of the 
skull that exceeds the limits of compensation, generally accepted as a 
sustained increase ≥20 mmHg.
	
a.	 Intricately related to cerebral perfusion via the following equation:
Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) =
Mean arterial pressure (MAP)−ICP
	
b.	 Most commonly caused by brain trauma, tumors, or intracranial 
infections.
	
c.	 Patients present with headache, diplopia, nausea, vomiting, or 
decreased level of consciousness.
	
d.	 Assess for signs of trauma, ataxia, pupillary asymmetry, papilledema, 
cranial nerve dysfunction, bulging fontanelle, or abnormal posturing.
	
(1)	 Foramen magnum herniation: hypertension, bradycardia, irregu-
lar respirations (Cushing triad)
	
(2)	 Transtentorial herniation: ipsilateral papillary dilation, contralateral 
hemiparesis
	
e.	 Evaluation may include infectious studies, electrolytes, toxicology 
screen, and stat CT head. Lumbar puncture is contraindicated due 
to herniation risk if cause is obstructive.
	2.	 Management: Adequate CPP (>40 mmHg) is critical to overcome the 
resistance of increased ICP.
	
a.	 Stabilize initially as per resuscitation guidelines.
	
(1)	 Maintain normal oxygenation and ventilation to treat increased meta-
bolic demand and avoid hypercarbia-­related cerebral vasodilation.
	
(2)	 Consider hyperventilation (EtCO2 target between 25 and 30) for 
patients with active evidence of herniation. Prophylactic hyper-
ventilation is otherwise not recommended.
	
(3)	 Support MAP with adequate isotonic fluid resuscitation and vaso-
active agents.
	
b.	 Consultation with neurosurgical team is recommended and required 
immediately if evidence of herniation is present.
	
c.	 Administer mannitol (0.25 to 1 g/kg) and/or hypertonic saline (5 to 10 
mL/kg of 3% hypertonic saline) in case of acute neurologic deteriora-
tion or cerebral herniation.
	
(1)	 Continuous infusions of 3% hypertonic saline (0.5 to 1.5 mL/kg/h) 
may be titrated as necessary to maintain ICP less than 20 mmHg.
	
(2)	 Rapid osmotic diuresis from mannitol may cause hypovolemia 
and hypotension, especially in polytrauma patients.
	
d.	 Request noncontrast head CT to evaluate for emergent surgical 
pathology.
	
e.	 Treat acute seizure activity given the associated increased cere-
bral metabolic rate and subsequent increased cerebral blood flow. 
Consider prophylactic antiseizure therapy (e.g., phenytoin, levetirace-
tam), if transport or delayed definitive care is anticipated.
 

--- Page 45 ---
32    Part I  Pediatric Acute Care
	
f.	 Sedation and analgesia prevent increases in ICP related to pain and 
agitation, although benefit is balanced with risk of hypotension and 
alteration of neurologic exam.
	
g.	 Avoid secondary brain injury by maintaining neuroprotective param-
eters: Maintain head midline and elevated at 30 degrees, normogly-
cemia, normonatremia, normothermia, and correct acidosis.
	
h.	 If elevated ICP is refractory to medical management, consider draining 
an existing ventriculoperitoneal shunt or acute neurosurgical interven-
tion (external ventricular drain or decompressive craniectomy).
	
i.	 For elevated ICP refractory to medical and surgical management, 
consider barbiturate coma. 
IV.  CRITICAL CARE REFERENCE DATA
	1.	 Minute ventilation (VE):
	
VE =  Respiratory rate × Tidal volume  (VT)	
	2.	 Alveolar gas equation:
	
PAO2 =   [FiO2 (Patm −PH2O)] −(PaCO2/R)	
	
a.	 PAO2 = Alveolar partial pressure of oxygen
	
b.	 FiO2 = Inspired fraction of oxygen (0.21 at room air)
	
c.	 Patm = Atmospheric pressure (760 mmHg at sea level; adjust for high 
altitude)
	
d.	 PH2O = Water vapor pressure (47 mmHg)
	
e.	 PaCO2 = Arteriolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide (measured via 
arterial blood gas)
	
f.	 R = Respiratory quotient (0.8; CO2 produced/O2 consumed)
	3.	 Alveolar-­arterial oxygen gradient (A-­a gradient):
	
A−a gradient  =  PAO2 −PaO2	
	
a.	 PAO2 = Alveolar partial pressure of oxygen (estimated from alveolar 
gas equation)
	
b.	 PaO2 = Arteriolar partial pressure of oxygen (measured via arterial 
blood gas)
	
c.	 Normal gradient is 20 to 65 mmHg on 100% oxygen or 5 to 20 mmHg 
on room air
	
d.	 The A-­a gradient is increased in hypoventilation, diffusion limitations, 
pulmonary blood-­flow shunts and ventilation/blood flow (V/Q) mismatch.
	4.	 Oxygenation index (OI):
	
OI  =  Paw × FiO2 × 100 / PaO2	
	
a.	 Paw (mmHg) = Mean airway pressure
	
b.	 OI >40 in hypoxemic respiratory failure is historically considered an 
indication for extracorporeal life support.

 See additional content on Expert Consult
I.  COMPONENTS OF THE TRAUMA ASSESSMENT
A.  Primary Survey
	1.	 The primary survey includes assessment of ABCDE (airway, breathing, 
circulation, disability, exposure/exsanguination). This includes intrave-
nous (IV) access, preferably two large-­bore catheters.
	2.	 NOTE: The Advanced Trauma Life Support algorithm developed by the 
American College of Surgeons continues to support the ABC sequence 
in the primary survey. For nontraumatic cardiorespiratory arrest, the 
circulation, airway, and breathing (CAB) sequence is currently in use by 
the American Heart Association as part of the Pediatric Advanced Life 
Support algorithm (see Chapter 1).
B. Secondary Survey (Fig. 2.1) 
II.  HEAD AND NECK TRAUMA
A.  Head Imaging
	1.	 The PECARN algorithm (Fig. 2.2) is often used to assess risk for clini-
cally important traumatic brain injury.1
	2.	 If signs of traumatic brain injury on computed tomography (CT), con-
sider consultation by pediatric neurosurgery/trauma surgeon. 
B.  Cervical Spine and Neck Imaging
	1.	 There are currently no unified protocols or clinical guidelines for pediat-
ric cervical spine clearance after blunt trauma.
	2.	 Based on PECARN C-­Spine criteria,2 consider obtaining imaging if any 
of the following are present in a patient ≤16 years old:
	
a.	 Altered mental status
	
b.	 Focal neurologic deficits
	
c.	 Complaint of neck pain
	
d.	 Torticollis
	
e.	 Substantial injury to the torso
	
f.	 Predisposing condition
	
g.	 High-­risk motor vehicle crash
	
h.	 Diving accident
	3.	 Note, many institutions alternatively use NEXUS criteria for clinical c-­
spine clearance. This is validated in children ≥8 years old3 and includes 
#1, 2, and 3 of PECARN c-­spine plus presence of intoxication or pain-
ful, distracting injury.4,5

36    Part I  Pediatric Acute Care
	4.	 Recent guidelines by the Pediatric Cervical Spine Clearance Working 
Group Algorithm6 additionally highlight the following factors:
	
a.	 In patients ≤3 years old, consider plain radiographs, if c-­spine can-
not be cleared clinically.
	
b.	 Clinical clearance can be done regardless of mechanism of injury if a 
child is ≥3 years and is asymptomatic with normal mental status and 
normal physical examination.
	
c.	 Clinical clearance CANNOT be performed if the child is observed to 
have or reports persistent neck pain, or if there is abnormal head 
posture or difficulty in neck movement. 
C.  Specific Imaging Studies
	1.	 C-­spine x-­ray (XR) with minimum of two views (lateral, anteroposterior, 
and/or odontoid views) (90% sensitivity in identifying bony cervical 
spine injury).7
	2.	 Consider further cross-­section imaging for further evaluation of vertebral 
cervical fracture.8
	3.	 Consider magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan for further evaluation 
of ligamentous and cord cervical spine injury.9,10
	4.	 Spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA): 
Neurologic symptoms persist with no radiographic abnormality. Of note, 
recent research found that MRI revealed abnormal features only in 
those patients with complete neurologic deficits and may lack sensitivity 
with abnormal features associated with partial or temporary neurologic 
deficits.11,12
	5.	 If signs of spinal column or vascular injury on imaging, consider consul-
tation by trauma, spine, and/or neck surgeon. 
III.  CONCUSSION
A.  Concussion Evaluation
	1.	 The Acute Concussion Evaluation (ACE) can be used in multiple set-
tings (see Section XI. Resources), including the clinic and emergency 
department (ED).13–15
	2.	 Patients should be referred to a concussion specialist if symptoms 
persist greater than 10 to 14 days, if they worsen, or if a patient has a 
history of multiple concussions. 
B.  Return-­to-­school and Return-­to-­play Guidelines (Table 2.1)
	1.	 Overarching goal is to allow healing from first injury in an attempt to 
prevent “second impact syndrome”: Diffuse cerebral swelling in the set-
ting of a second concussion that occurred while still symptomatic from 
an earlier concussion. This is a rare but potentially fatal complication of 
concussions.
	2.	 Consider providing the ACE Care Plan for parent and child guidance 
(see Section XI. Resources).
	3.	 Brain rest: Although evidence-­based guidelines for brain rest following 
concussion are limited, current research suggests that extreme rest 
(i.e., bed rest) can hinder recovery from concussions.16 Other studies 
 

--- Page 53 ---
Chapter 2  Traumatic Injuries    37
2
have found that some degree of cognitive rest can be beneficial and 
that patients presenting with signs of injury following concussion (e.g., 
loss of consciousness, posttraumatic amnesia) are more likely to benefit 
from rest following concussion than those patients presenting with 
symptoms alone (somatic, cognitive, affective, and sleep-­related symp-
toms).17
	4.	 For further guidelines, please discuss with concussion specialist. 
IV.  THORACIC AND ABDOMINAL TRAUMA EVALUATION18
A.  Physical Exam
“Seat belt sign” is a significant predictive factor for surgical abdominal 
injury after blunt trauma (sensitivity 70.6%, specificity 82.4%).19 
B.  Laboratory Studies to Consider
Type and cross-­match, complete blood cell count (CBC; low hemoglobin 
indicates possible hemorrhage; however, this is a late sign), electrolytes, 
TABLE 2.1
RETURN-­TO-­PLAY AND RETURN-­TO-­SCHOOL15
Return-­to-­Play Guidelines
Return-­to-­School Guidelines
BRIEF GUIDELINES
Each step should last a minimum of 24 hr.
Move to the next level of activity only if no  
symptoms are experienced.
If symptoms return, patients should stop activi-
ties and notify a health professional.
After evaluation, once the patient has not 
had symptoms for minimum 24 hr, patients 
should resume play at the previous tolerated 
step of the return to play guidelines.
BRIEF GUIDELINES41
If symptoms affect concentration or if unable 
to tolerate stimulation for more than 30 min 
without symptoms, consider remaining at home 
with light mental activities (watching TV, light 
reading, and interaction with the family), so 
long as they do not provoke symptoms. Minimize 
computer use, texting, and video games.
If able to tolerate stimulation for minimum 
of 30–45 min without symptoms, consider 
returning to learning with modifications.
Providers should provide school notes.
Step 1: No physical activity
Step 2: Low levels of physical activity
Examples: Walking, light jogging, light station-
ary biking, light weightlifting (lower weight 
with higher repetitions, no bench, no squat)
Step 3: Moderate levels of physical activity with 
body/head movement
Examples: Moderate jogging, brief running, 
moderate-intensity stationary biking, 
moderate-­intensity weightlifting (reduced time 
and/or reduced weight from typical routine)
Step 4: Heavy noncontact physical activity
Examples: Sprinting/running, high-­intensity 
stationary biking, regular weightlifting 
routine, noncontact sport-­specific drills (in 
three planes of movement)
Step 5: Full contact in controlled practice
Step 6: Full contact in game play
SUGGESTED SCHOOL MODIFICATIONS:
Shortened school days
Frequent breaks during classes
Extra time to complete coursework/assignments 
and tests
Decreased homework load
No significant classroom or standardized test-
ing at this time
Consider 504 Plan and/or Individualized Educa-
tion Plan (IEP)
 

--- Page 54 ---
38    Part I  Pediatric Acute Care
liver function tests (high AST/ALT indicate liver injury), lipase (high level 
indicates pancreatic injury), and urinalysis (hematuria indicates possible 
renal/bladder injury). 
C.  Imaging Studies to Consider
	1.	 Chest radiograph
	
a.	 Look for rib fracture, pneumothorax and/or hemothorax, pulmonary 
contusion, pneumomediastinum.
	
b.	 Consider chest CT with IV contrast, if recommended by radiologist 
and/or trauma surgeon.
	2.	 Pelvis radiograph
	
a.	 Look for pelvis fracture.
	
b.	 Consider pelvis CT if recommended by radiologist and/or trauma 
surgeon.
	3.	 Abdominal/pelvis CT with IV contrast
	
a.	 This is the “gold standard” for intra-­abdominal injury diagnosis; 
however, radiographs should be obtained first if there is concern for 
additional injuries that would compromise clinical stability.
	
b.	 For blunt abdominal trauma, routine oral contrast is not indicated, whereas 
IV contrast can help to identify visceral, vascular, or bowel injury.20
	
c.	 For penetrating abdominal trauma, triple contrast (oral, rectal, IV) CT 
to identify peritoneal penetration or intra-­abdominal organ injury in 
stable stab wound victims.21
	
d.	 Look for duodenal hematoma, hemoperitoneum, bladder injury, solid 
organ hemorrhage (e.g., spleen and/or liver).
	
e.	 If gross hematuria or urinalysis with greater than 50 RBC/hpf, con-
sider genitourinary tract trauma and consider CT abdomen and pel-
vis with and without IV contrast (CT urography) and CT cystogram, in 
consultation with radiology/urologist/trauma surgeon.
	4.	 Extended focused assessment with sonography for trauma (eFAST)
	
a.	 Can help to identify intra-­abdominal free fluid and parenchymal 
injury (sensitivity 50%, specificity 85%).22
	
b.	 eFAST with bilateral anterior lung views is highly sensitive for pneu-
mothorax.
	
c.	 Consider performing if qualified personnel available.
	5.	 If any workup is positive for thoracic or abdominal trauma, immediate 
consultation with nearest pediatric trauma center/surgeon is indicated. 
V.  ORTHOPEDIC/LONG BONE TRAUMA
A.  Physical Exam
	1.	 Look for swelling, ecchymosis, or deformity. Look for breaks in the skin 
(abrasions, lacerations) overlying the apex of the fracture suggestive of 
open fracture.
	2.	 Bleeding
	
a.	 Consider arterial bleed if absent pulses and cool extremity with bleeding.
	
b.	 Consider venous bleed if persistent pulse with bleeding.
 

--- Page 55 ---
Chapter 2  Traumatic Injuries    39
2
	3.	 Compartment syndrome: Tense, swollen area at site of injury, pain, 
paresthesia, paresis, pallor, pulselessness (if unable to palpate pulse, 
consider using vascular ultrasound with Doppler).
	4.	 If signs/symptoms of compartment syndrome or open fracture, consul-
tation with a pediatric orthopedic surgeon is recommended. 
B.  Imaging
	1.	 Children’s bones are less densely calcified, have thickened periosteum, 
and have a growth plate, all of which increase their vulnerability to 
fractures.
	2.	 Obtain radiographs if bony point tenderness or deformity, decreased 
sensation, decreased range of motion, or overlying skin discoloration.
	3.	 Radiographs with anterior-­posterior and lateral views ± oblique and 
including areas above and below the suspected area of injury are rec-
ommended. 
C.  Fractures Unique to Children
	1.	 Physeal or Salter-­Harris fractures18: Fractures involving growth plates 
(see Chapter 26).
	2.	 Plastic fractures: Pliability of bones in response to compressive and 
transverse forces.
	
a.	 Torus or buckle fracture: Compression injury with buckled cortex
	
b.	 Greenstick fracture: Fracture on one side of the diaphysis with cortex 
intact on other side of diaphysis
	
c.	 Bowing or bending fractures
	3.	 Avulsion fractures: Tendon or ligament dislodging a bone fragment. 
These are more common among adolescents participating in sports. 
D.  Fractures Requiring Urgent Orthopedic Surgeon Consultation
	1.	 Open fractures
	2.	 Unacceptably displaced fractures
	3.	 Fractures with associated neurovascular compromise (consider emer-
gent reduction to improve neurovascular status if orthopedic surgery is 
not available on-­site)
	4.	 Significant growth plate or joint injuries
	5.	 Complete or displaced fractures of the long bones of the extremities
	6.	 Pelvic fractures (other than minor avulsions)
	7.	 Spinal fractures
	8.	 Dislocations of major joints other than the shoulder
E. Fractures That Are Appropriate to Manage Acutely With Outpatient 
Referral to Orthopedics (Table 2.2) 
VI.  DENTAL TRAUMA
A.  Components of a Tooth (Fig. 2.3)
B. Differences Between Primary and Permanent Teeth (Fig. 2.4)
	1.	 Primary teeth appear 6 months to 3 years of age, are relatively smaller, 
whiter, front teeth have a smooth biting surface.
 

--- Page 56 ---
40    Part I  Pediatric Acute Care
	2.	 Permanent teeth appear 6 years to 21 years of age, relatively larger, 
front teeth have a ridged biting surface. 
C.  Dental Injuries
	1.	 Avulsion
	
a.	 An avulsion injury involves complete displacement of the tooth from 
the alveolar socket.23
	
b.	 If a primary tooth, outpatient dental follow-­up is appropriate.
	
c.	 If a permanent tooth, this is a dental emergency!

d.	 Most important: Immediate reimplantation should occur within 60 
minutes to maximize tooth viability. Without a tooth present, the peri-
odontal ligament can degenerate.
	
e.	 Method:
	
(1)	 Pick up the avulsed tooth by the crown and avoid touching the 
root to prevent injury to the periodontal ligament.
	
(2)	 Wash the tooth briefly with saline or Hanks Balanced Salt Solution 
(HBSS).
	
(3)	 Administer local lidocaine into the gum if time permitting.
	
(4)	 Insert the root into the alveolar socket with concave part facing 
the tongue.
	
(5)	 Ask the patient to bite on gauze to hold it in position.
	
(6)	 Refer to a dentist emergently for splinting.
	
f.	 Reimplantation should always be attempted. If reimplantation is not 
possible, place the tooth in a container in osmolality balanced media 
(e.g., HBSS, cold milk) and refer to a dentist emergently for reimplan-
tation and splinting.
	2.	 Luxation
	
a.	 Luxation injuries result from physical displacement of tooth within 
the alveolar socket, tearing of the periodontal ligament with possible 
injury to the alveolar bone.24

42    Part I  Pediatric Acute Care
	
b.	 Primary tooth: If tooth is loose, there is an increased risk of aspira-
tion, and the tooth may be extracted with firm pressure with gauze. 
If tooth is not loose, may need repositioning and splinting. In both 
situations, refer to a dentist for evaluation within 48 hours.
	
c.	 Permanent tooth: Immediate dental evaluation required if significant 
tooth mobility; otherwise, outpatient evaluation within 48 hours is 
appropriate.
	3.	 Subluxation
	
a.	 Subluxation is characterized by tooth injury with minor mobility with-
out displacement.
	
b.	 Regardless of whether permanent or primary tooth, outpatient 
dental follow-­up, ideally within 48 hours, is needed to rule out  
root fracture.
	4.	 Tooth fracture:
	
a.	 Classify the fracture per involvement of enamel, dentin, and pulp.25 
	
b.	 For management guidelines: Table 2.3. 
D.  Anticipatory Guidance Following Dental Trauma
	1.	 Avoid contact sports
	2.	 Analgesics as needed for pain control (e.g., acetaminophen, ibuprofen, 
cold compresses)
	3.	 Soft diet
	4.	 Use a soft toothbrush, if able to brush teeth
	5.	 Regular follow-­up with a dentist 
VII.  OPHTHALMOLOGIC TRAUMA26
A.  Chemical Injury to the Eye18
	1.	 Determine if substance is an acid or alkali. Alkali solutions tend to be 
more damaging because they penetrate more deeply.
	2.	 Obtain a baseline pH by touching Litmus paper to the conjunctiva.
	3.	 Retract eye lids as much as possible and irrigate immediately with 
normal saline or lactated Ringer solution. This can be performed at the 
eyewash station or with a standard bag of fluid with tubing placed at the 
medial canthus. Allow the liquid to pass over the open eye to the lateral 
canthus.

	4.	 Continue irrigation for a minimum of 30 minutes with minimum 1 to 2 L 
of solution or until pH becomes neutral (7.0 to 7.4). Additional fluid may 
be required.
	5.	 Monitor conjunctival pH with Litmus paper 10 to 20 minutes after 
­irrigation.27
	6.	 Consider ophthalmologic consultation and discuss with Poison Control. 
B.  Ruptured Globe
	1.	 A ruptured globe is caused by laceration or puncture of the cornea 
and/or sclera following trauma caused by projectile, sharp, or blunt 
trauma.
	2.	 Key physical exam findings include: Teardrop shaped pupil pointing to-
wards perforation, hyphema (hemorrhage in the anterior chamber) and/
or subconjunctival hemorrhage, severe pain, decreased visual acuity, 
edema.
	3.	 Stop the exam and place a rigid eye shield.
	4.	 Elevate the head of the bed.
	5.	 Keep patient as calm as possible and control symptoms (e.g., antiemet-
ics and pain control) to avoid increased globe pressure and further 
extrusion of vitreous/aqueous humor.
	6.	 Immediately consult ophthalmology and administer antibiotics. 
C.  Corneal Abrasion
	1.	 Key physical exam findings include red eye with tearing, intense pain, 
resistance to eye opening, photophobia, foreign body sensation.
	2.	 Consider application of topical anesthetic before examination. If foreign 
body sensation is present on your exam, evert eyelids to look for re-
tained foreign body.
	3.	 Apply fluorescein staining and examine with Wood lamp. Focal uptake 
indicates abrasion.
	4.	 Consider ophthalmic ointment or artificial tears for lubrication and pain relief.
	5.	 Consider ophthalmologic consultation in the ED if concern for larger 
corneal abrasions involving visual axis, corneal laceration, ulceration, 
embedded foreign body, or prolonged healing (i.e., symptoms not 
improving after several days). 
D.  Superglue to the Eye28
	1.	 Trim eyelashes as needed with blunt-­tip scissors.
	2.	 Apply copious amounts of ointment, such as bacitracin ophthalmic 
ointment or baby shampoo, and gently massage eyelashes to break 
down the glue. Advise that the patient continue this as often as possible. 
Dissolution of glue may take several days.
	3.	 Consider consultation with ophthalmology if several days of ointment is 
unsuccessful. 
E.  Eyelid Laceration
	1.	 Consider consultation with ophthalmology if: Full-­thickness lacerations 
(exposed adipose tissue), laceration through the lid margin or tarsal plate, 
 

--- Page 60 ---
44    Part I  Pediatric Acute Care
lacerations involving lacrimal canaliculi (medial third of the upper/lower 
lids), or ptosis (unequal lifting of lids with upward gaze would suggest this).
	2.	 Some superficial lacerations that occur in the direction of a natural skin 
fold may not require repair. 
F.  Orbital Floor Fractures
	1.	 This injury is usually caused by blunt trauma and is often referred to as 
a “blow out fracture,” because the weakest area of the orbital bones is 
the orbital floor/maxillary roof.
	2.	 Key physical exam findings include: Eyelid swelling, ecchymosis, 
enophthalmos of affected eye, ptosis, diplopia, anesthesia of the cheek 
(involvement of infraorbital nerve), decreased extraocular eye move-
ments (especially decreased superior range of the globe due to inferior 
rectus entrapment).
	3.	 Evaluate for other eye injuries (e.g., retinal trauma, ruptured globe).
	4.	 Consider consultation with ophthalmology and plastics/otorhinolaryngol-
ogy surgeon. 
G.  Other Instances Requiring Ophthalmologic Consultation
	1.	 Traumatic iritis is associated with blunt trauma with painful red eye, 
pupillary constriction, and photophobia, often with delayed presentation 
of symptoms (24 to 72 hours) after trauma.
	2.	 Sudden loss of vision could suggest retrobulbar hemorrhage or retinal 
detachment. 
VIII.  ANIMAL BITES
A.  Wounds at the Highest Risk of Infection
	1.	 Bites over hand, foot, genitalia, or joint surface
	2.	 Bites from a cat or human
	3.	 Wounds in an asplenic or immunocompromised patient
	4.	 Wounds with delayed presentation to care >12 hours 
B.  Decision to Suture
	1.	 Avoid closing wounds at high risk of infection (see earlier) unless for 
cosmetic reasons, large wounds or wounds with edges far apart where 
loose approximation can be helpful.
	2.	 Wounds on head and neck can be safely sutured after copious irrigation 
and wound débridement if within 6 to 8 hours of injury and there are no 
signs of infection. Avoid skin glue due to high risk of infection.
	3.	 In large wounds, subcutaneous dead space should be closed with a 
minimal number of absorbable sutures, with delayed closure in 3 to 5 
days, if there is no evidence of infection.
	4.	 Wounds that involve tendons, joints, deep fascia, or major vasculature 
should be evaluated by a surgeon. 
C.  Antibiotic Prophylaxis29
	1.	 Table 2.4.
 

--- Page 61 ---
Chapter 2  Traumatic Injuries    45
2
	2.	 Consider IV antibiotics if patient is critically ill or unable to tolerate PO 
intake. 
D.  Tetanus Postexposure Prophylaxis: See Chapter 16
E.  Rabies Postexposure Prophylaxis: See Chapter 16 
IX.  BURNS
A.  Burns That Should Prompt Consideration of Elective Intubation
	1.	 Signs of inhalational injury (e.g., singed nasal hairs, soot at the nares, 
oropharyngeal erythema)
	2.	 Early onset ­stridor
	3.	 Severe burns of face and/or mouth
	4.	 Progressive respiratory insufficiency 
B.  Estimation of the Surface Area of Burns
	1.	 See Fig. 2.5.
	2.	 Only include partial-­ and full-­thickness burns and exclude superficial 
burns in the calculation of body surface area. 
C.  Estimation of the Depth of Burns (Table 2.5)
D.  Fluid Resuscitation in Patients With Burns (Fig. 2.6)
	1.	 Consider central venous access for burns greater than 25% BSA.
	2.	 Withhold potassium from IV fluids generally for the first 48 hours be-
cause of a large release of potassium from damaged tissues.
	3.	 Foley catheter placement is recommended to monitor urine output dur-
ing fluid resuscitation phase. 
E.  Indications for Transfer to a Burn Center30
	1.	 ≥10% partial-­thickness and/or full-­thickness burns
	2.	 ≥5% full-­thickness burns
	3.	 If burn débridement is warranted (e.g., any partial-­thickness burn >2 
cm in diameter)
	4.	 Respiratory involvement and/or major trauma
	5.	 Electrical, chemical, or inhalation injury
	6.	 Burns of critical areas, such as face, hands, feet, perineum, or joints
	7.	 Circumferential burns

F.  Management of Burns Not Referred to Burn Center
	1.	 For a partial-­thickness burn not requiring débridement:
	
a.	 Clean with warm saline or mild soap and water.
	
b.	 Apply topical antibacterial agent such as bacitracin (requires daily 
dressing changes) or silver-­impregnated dressings (dressing can be

	2.	 Follow-­up inspections of wound should occur at 24 and 72 hours.
	3.	 Follow-­up within one week at a pediatric burn center is highly 
­recommended.
	4.	 Oral antibiotics are not indicated. 
G.  Other Special Considerations With Burns
	1.	 Circumferential burns can increase risk of compartment syndrome.
	2.	 Tetanus prophylaxis is warranted with burns. Refer to Chapter 16 for details. 
H.  Other Types of Burns
	1.	 Household electrical burn31: In general, household outlets are 120 to 
240 V and rarely cause serious injuries or cardiac arrhythmias.
	2.	 High-­voltage burns (>1000 V), including lightning burns:
	
a.	 Patients are at increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias or asystole. 
Consider cardiac monitoring for 48 hours.31
	
b.	 Patients are also at increased risk of compression spine fractures or

spinal cord injury due to tetany, as well as compartment syndrome, 
rhabdomyolysis, and hyperkalemia due to muscle swelling. 
X.  NONACCIDENTAL TRAUMA
A.  Physical Abuse
	1.	 Red flags in history
	
a.	 Delay in presentation
	
b.	 Inconsistent/incomplete/vague/changing explanations for significant injury
	
c.	 History is inconsistent with age, pattern, or severity of the injury
	
d.	 History is inconsistent with child’s physical or developmental 
­capabilities
	
e.	 Different witnesses provide different explanation
	2.	 Concerning physical exam findings32
	
a.	 Bruises: In protected areas (chest, abdomen, back, buttocks), mul-
tiple, in various stages of healing, those that do not fit history or devel-
opmental stage of child, in unusual places (e.g., postauricular, neck, 
inner aspect of arms), those consistent with slap of hand or pinch.
	
b.	 Burns: Multiple, well-­demarcated, stocking/glove distribution, sym-
metrically burned palms/soles, buttocks and/or lower legs, mirror 
image burns of extremities, spared inguinal or other flexural creases, 
appearance of a cigarette burn.
	
c.	 Other: Frenulum tears, loop marks from cord or cable, bites.
	
d.	 See Figs. 2.7–2.10 (color plates) and Figs. EC 2.A-D for examples.
	3.	 Imaging guidelines
	
a.	 Skeletal survey33–35
	
(1)	 In children less than 2 years of age, use skeletal survey to evalu-
ate for bony injury. This includes frontal and lateral views of the 
skull, lateral views of the cervical spine and thoracolumbosacral 
spine, and single frontal views of the long bones, hands, feet, 
chest, and abdomen.

(2)	 In children greater than 5 years of age, targeted imaging to the 
area(s) of suspected injury is usually appropriate. The utility of 
screening with skeletal survey diminishes after 5 years of age.
	
(3)	 In children 2 to 5 years of age, decisions about type of imaging 
are open to clinical judgement.
	
(4)	 Do not use “babygrams” (i.e., whole-­body x-­rays in one image) 
because of the high rate of false-­negatives.
	
(5)	 Follow-­up skeletal survey approximately 2 weeks after the initial 
examination should be performed when abnormal or equivocal 
findings are found on initial study and when abuse is suspected 
on clinical grounds to identify fractures missed on initial survey.
	
(6)	 Fractures with an association with child abuse include rib 
fractures, metaphyseal bucket and corner fractures, spine and 
scapula fractures, and complex skull fractures (Fig. 2.11 and 
Figs. EC 2.E-G for examples).
	
b.	 Head CT without contrast if:
	
(1)	 Less than 6 months of age with suspected abuse
	
(2)	 Neurologic changes
	
(3)	 Facial injuries concerning for abuse
	
c.	 Additional imaging/consultation
	
(1)	 Ophthalmologic evaluation for retinal hemorrhages.
	
(2)	 MRI may identify lesions not detected by CT (e.g., posterior fossa 
injury and diffuse axonal injury).
	4.	 What to do if physical abuse is suspected
	
a.	 All healthcare providers are required by law to report suspected child 
maltreatment to the local police and/or child welfare agency.
	
b.	 In addition, consider consultation with local child injury/abuse specialist.
	
c.	 Medical stabilization is the primary goal; prevention of further injuries 
is the long-­term goal.
	
d.	 The professional who makes such reports is immune from any civil 
or criminal liability.
	
e.	 Carefully and legibly document the following:
	
(1)	 Reported and suspected history and mechanisms of injury.
	
(2)	 Any history given by the victim in his or her own words (use 
quotation marks).
	
(3)	 Information provided by other providers or services.
	
(4)	 Physical examination findings, including drawings of injuries and 
details of dimensions, color, shape, and texture. Consider early use 
of police crime laboratory photography to document injuries. If tak-
ing photos, start with full patient, then part of patient, then zoomed 
into wound, and then take a separate photo of wrist identification 
band.

B.  Sexual Abuse
	1.	 Physical Exam Findings
	
a.	 Normal genital examination does not rule out abuse; most examina-
tions are normal in cases of abuse.36
	
b.	 Table 2.6 for physical exam findings highly suggestive of sexual abuse.37
	2.	 What to do if sexual abuse is suspected38
	
a.	 If suspected sexual abuse occurred within 72 hours to a child 
younger than 12 years or within 120 hours to a child older than 12 
years, defer interview and examination and urgently involve a multi-
disciplinary team with a sexual assault nurse examiner with expertise 
in the evaluation of sexual abuse.
	
b.	 Nonacute examinations falling outside of the above time windows 
should be deferred to a child advocacy center.
	
c.	 Genital examination should be performed by a trained forensic 
­specialist.
	
d.	 Evaluate the need for sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing.
	3.	 STI testing
	
a.	 Tests include: Serum human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), serum 
syphilis, gonorrhea (culture or NAAT from pharynx and anus in boys 
and girls, vagina in girls and urethra in boys), chlamydia (culture or 
NAAT from anus in boys and girls, vagina in girls).
	
b.	 In adolescents, recommended for all patients.
	
c.	 In prepubertal children, consider testing if:
	
(1)	 Experienced penetration of the vagina or anus
	
(2)	 Abuse by a stranger

Toxicology
Maria D. Latham, MD
 See additional content on Expert Consult
Whenever ingestion is suspected, contact local poison control at 
1-­800-­222-­1222.
Each year the American Association of Poison Control Centers records 
more than 1.2 million childhood poisoning exposures. Of these exposures, 
76% occur in children younger than the age of 6 years. Exposures in young 
children are often unintentional, whereas adolescents are more likely to 
have intentional ingestions.1
I.  INITIAL EVALUATION
A.  History
	1.	 Exposure history
Obtain history from witnesses and/or close contacts. Route, timing, and 
number of exposures (acute, chronic, or repeated ingestion), prior treat-
ments or decontamination efforts.2,3
	2.	 Substance identification and quantity ingested
Attempt to identify exact name of substance(s) ingested, including: product 
name, active ingredients, possible contaminants, expiration date, concentra-
tion, and dose. Attempt to estimate the missing volume of liquid or the number 
of missing pills from a container. Poison control can assist with pill identification.
3. Environmental information
Accessible items in the house or garage; open containers; spilled tablets; 
household members taking medications, visitors to the house, herbs, or 
other complementary medicines.2 
B.  Workup and Laboratory Investigation
	1.	 Electrocardiogram (ECG): Several medications will cause ECG changes, 
including QRS prolongation.
	2.	 Blood Tests
	
a.	 Individual drug levels such as acetaminophen, aspirin, and ethanol 
are helpful general screenings in an acute, unknown ingestion.
	
b.	 Acetaminophen levels are especially important to test in suicidal 
ingestions. Acetaminophen is detected in 1/500 of all suicidal 
ingestions even when it is not reported as an ingested agent.3
	
c.	 Venous blood gas, blood glucose, and serum electrolytes.
	3.	 Urine Toxicology Screens
	
a.	 Basic screens include amphetamines, cocaine, opiates, phencycli-
dine (PCP), and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).

b.	 Positive results are presumptive only; must be confirmed by gas 
chromatography/mass spectrometry.4 
C.  Clinical Diagnostic Aids (Table EC 3.A)
II.  TOXIDROMES
See Table 3.1. 
III.  INGESTIONS AND ANTIDOTES
See Table 3.2.
A.  Decontamination
	1.	 Activated charcoal5
	
a.	 Most effective when used within first hour after ingestion but can be 
given after first hour, especially for sustained-­release preparations. 
Should be given PO to an awake and alert patient. Nasogastric (NG)
tube should be used only if a patient is intubated.
	
b.	 Substances not absorbed by charcoal: Iron, alcohols, lithium
	
c.	 Contraindications: Unprotected airway, caustic ingestion, disrupted 
gastrointestinal tract, concern for aspiration
	2.	 Whole bowel irrigation
	
a.	 Indicated for evacuation of substances not bound to activated 
charcoal such as iron, lead-­containing foreign bodies, fatal sustained 
release products, drug packing.
	
b.	 Use a polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution preparation to irri-
gate the bowel. Recommended rates: 9 months to 6 years (500 
mL/hr), 6 to 12 years (1000 mL/hr), more than 12 years (1500 to 
2000 mL/hr). 
B.  Enhanced Removal
	1.	 Hemodialysis or exchange transfusions may be indicated to remove a 
drug/toxin.
	2.	 Ingestions that may require enhanced removal therapies: Salicylate, 
lithium, methanol, ethylene glycol, metformin-­associated lactic acidosis, 
valproate, theophylline 
C.  Other Considerations
	1.	 Many ingestions managed primarily with supportive care of any associ-
ated toxic effects, such as hypotension or hyperpyrexia.
	2.	 Seizures: First line agents are benzodiazepines. Barbiturates or propofol 
should be considered as second line agents. Phenytoin has no role in 
the treatment of toxin-­induced seizures.6
	3.	 Patients with severe poisoning and refractory cardiorespiratory failure 
after ingestion are potential extracorporeal membrane oxygenation 
(ECMO) candidates because the toxic effects are transient.

IV.  ACETAMINOPHEN OVERDOSE7
NAPQI metabolite is hepatotoxic.
A.  Four Phases of Intoxication
	1.	 Phase 1 (first 24 hours): Nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, mal-
aise, vomiting.
	2.	 Phase 2 (24 to 72 hours): Above symptoms resolve; right upper quad-
rant pain, hepatomegaly, and increasing transaminases develop.
	3.	 Phase 3 (72 to 96 hours): Return of nonspecific symptoms as well as 
evidence of liver failure (increased prothrombin time, lactate, phos-
phate), renal failure, and encephalopathy.
	4.	 Phase 4 (4 days to 2 weeks): Recovery or death. 
B.  Treatment Criteria
	1.	 Serum acetaminophen concentration above the possible toxicity line 
on the Rumack-­Matthew nomogram after single acute ingestion 
(Fig. 3.1).
	2.	 History of ingesting more than 200 mg/kg or 10 g (whichever is less) and 
serum concentration not available or time of ingestion not known.
	3.	 If time of ingestion is unknown or multiple/chronic ingestion, check 
acetaminophen level and AST. Treat if either is elevated. 
C.  Antidote: N-­Acetylcysteine (See Formulary)
	1.	 PO: 140 mg/kg loading dose followed by 70 mg/kg Q4 hours for 17 
doses (18 total doses including loading dose).
	2.	 Intravenous (IV): 150 mg/kg N-­acetylcysteine IV loading dose over 60 
minutes, followed by 50 mg/kg over 4 hours, followed by 100 mg/kg 
over 16 hours for a total infusion time of 21 hours. Some patients may 
require more than 21 hours of N-­acetylcysteine administration.
	3.	 Liver failure: Continue the 100 mg/kg over 16 hours infusion until 
resolution of encephalopathy, AST less than 1000 units/L, and INR 
less than 2. 
V.  LEAD POISONING8
A.  Definition:
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines a reference level 
of 5 mCg/dL to identify children with elevated blood lead levels (BLLs). 
B.  Sources of Exposure:
Paint, dust, soil, drinking water, cosmetics, cookware, toys, and caregiv-
ers with occupations and/or hobbies using lead-­containing materials or 
substances. 
C.  Overview of Symptoms by Blood Lead Level:

Procedures
Andrew Percy, MD
 See additional content on Expert Consult
I.  GENERAL GUIDELINES
A.  Consent
Before performing any procedure, it is crucial to obtain informed consent 
from the parent or guardian by explaining the procedure, the indications, 
any risks involved, and any alternatives. Obtaining consent should not 
impede life-­saving, emergency procedures. 
B.  Risks
	1.	 All invasive procedures involve pain, risk for infection and bleeding, and 
potential injury to neighboring structures.
	2.	 Sedation and analgesia should be planned in advance, and the risks 
of such explained to the parent and/or patient as appropriate. (See 
Chapter 6 and the AAP Guidelines for Monitoring and Management of 
Pediatric Patients Before, During, and After Sedation for Diagnostic and 
Therapeutic Procedures.1)
	3.	 Universal precautions and proper sterile technique should be followed 
for all patient contact that exposes the healthcare provider to bodily 
fluids. 
C.  Documentation
It is important that the physician performing the procedure document the 
informed consent process. Include the date, time, additional personnel 
present (if applicable), brief summary of the consent conversation, the 
diagnosis, recommended procedure, specific risks and benefits, and alter-
native treatments. It is equally important to document if a patient refuses a 
procedure and that the risks associated with refusal were discussed. 
D.  Attending to the Needs of a Fearful Child
Children represent a vulnerable population in that they often lack the 
capacity to understand why a potentially uncomfortable procedure is being 
performed. All efforts should be made to provide information about the pro-
cedure to the child at an age-­appropriate level. Utilize Child Life Specialists 
as able. When possible, allow the child to touch unfamiliar objects in the 
examination room to desensitize them and enhance trust. Address the 
child’s fears. Toddlers often fear separation from the parent. Older children 
often fear pain. Adolescents often worry about embarrassment sustained 
by expressing anxiety or fear. Encourage active parent participation and 
presence. Allow all children a degree of basic autonomy such as selecting 
the postprocedure bandage color.

II.  ULTRASOUND FOR PROCEDURES
A.  Introduction to Ultrasound
Ultrasound has become an increasingly important bedside diagnostic and 
procedural aid, and it can improve visualization of subcutaneous structures 
during procedures. 
B.  Ultrasound Basics
	1.	 Probe Selection
	
a.	 Linear transducers use higher frequencies to produce higher resolu-
tion images and are primarily used for procedures in pediatrics. A 
wide area of contact at the skin surface facilitates needle placement 
in procedures.
	
b.	 Curvilinear transducers use low to midrange frequencies and permit 
deep structure visualization. Though they provide a wide area of skin 
contact to facilitate procedures near concave and convex surfaces, 
larger curvilinear probes are difficult to use in small children.
	
c.	 There are a variety of other probes (phased-­array, microconvex) 
that generate sector shaped images but are predominantly used for 
diagnostic purposes.
	2.	 Image Optimization
	
a.	 Ensure adequate contact by using enough ultrasound gel and apply-
ing comfortable pressure on the skin.
	
b.	 Gain: Measure of image brightness which is used for optimizing 
images and reducing artifact.
	
c.	 Frequency: Increase to improve image resolution of shallow struc-
tures. Decrease to improve imaging of deep structures.
	
d.	 Depth: Adjust to visualize structure of interest and at least a centime-
ter of tissue below that structure. 
III.  NEUROLOGIC PROCEDURES: LUMBAR PUNCTURE2,3
A.  Indications:
Examination of spinal fluid for suspected infection, inflammatory disorder, 
or malignancy, instillation of intrathecal chemotherapy, or measurement of 
opening pressure. 
B.  Complications:
Local pain, infection, bleeding, spinal fluid leak, hematoma, spinal head-
ache, and acquired epidermal spinal cord tumor (caused by implantation 
of epidermal material into the spinal canal if no stylet is used on skin entry). 
C.  Cautions and Contraindications:
	1.	 Increased intracranial pressure (ICP): Before lumbar puncture (LP), 
perform a funduscopic examination. Presence of papilledema, retinal 
hemorrhage, or clinical suspicion of increased ICP should prompt fur-
ther evaluation and may be a contraindication to the procedure. A sud-
den drop in spinal canal fluid pressure by rapid release of cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) may cause fatal herniation. Computed tomography (CT) 
 

--- Page 94 ---
Chapter 4  Procedures    63
4
may be indicated before LP if there is suspected intracranial bleeding, 
focal mass lesion, or increased ICP. A normal CT scan does not rule out 
increased ICP but usually excludes conditions that may put the patient 
at risk for herniation. Decision to obtain CT should not delay appropriate 
antibiotic therapy, if indicated.
	2.	 Bleeding diathesis: Platelet count greater than 50,000/mm3 is desir-
able before LP, and correction of any clotting factor deficiencies can 
minimize the risk for bleeding and subsequent cord or nerve root 
compression.
	3.	 Overlying skin infection may result in inoculation of CSF with organisms.
	4.	 LP should be deferred in unstable patients, and appropriate therapy 
should be initiated, including antibiotics, if indicated. 
D.  Procedure:
	1.	 Apply local anesthetic cream if sufficient time is available.
	2.	 Position child (Fig. 4.1) in either the sitting position or lateral recumbent 
position, with hips, knees, and neck flexed. Keep shoulders and hips 
aligned to avoid rotating the spine. Do not compromise a small infant’s 
cardiorespiratory status with positioning.
	3.	 Locate the desired intervertebral space (either L3 to L4 or L4 to L5) 
by drawing an imaginary line between the top of the iliac crests. 
Alternatively, ultrasound can be used to mark the intervertebral space 
(see Section XI, Online Content).
	4.	 Prepare the skin in a sterile fashion. Drape conservatively to make moni-
toring the infant possible. Use a 20-­ to 22-­G spinal needle with stylet 
(1.5, 2.5, or 3.5 inch depending on the size of the child). A smaller-­
gauge needle will decrease the incidence of spinal headache and CSF 
leak.
	5.	 Overlying skin and interspinous tissue can be anesthetized with 1% 
lidocaine using a 25G needle.
	6.	 Puncture the skin in the midline just caudad to the palpated spinous 
process, angling slightly cephalad toward the umbilicus. Advance 
several millimeters at a time, and withdraw stylet frequently to check for 
CSF flow. Needle may be advanced without the stylet once it is com-
pletely through the skin. In small infants, one may not feel a change in 
resistance or “pop” as the dura is penetrated.
	7.	 If resistance is met initially and the needle cannot be advanced, with-
draw needle to just under the skin surface and redirect the angle of the 
needle slightly.
	8.	 Send CSF for appropriate studies. In general, send the first tube for 
culture and Gram stain, the second tube for measurement of glucose 
and protein levels, and the last tube for cell count and differential. 
Additional tubes can be collected for viral cultures, polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR), or CSF metabolic studies, if indicated. If subarachnoid 
hemorrhage or traumatic tap is suspected, send the first and fourth 
tubes for cell count, and ask the laboratory to examine the CSF for 
xanthochromia.
 

--- Page 95 ---
64    Part I  Pediatric Acute Care
	9.	 Accurate measurement of CSF pressure can be made only with the 
patient lying quietly on his or her side in an unflexed position. It is not a 
reliable measurement in the sitting position. Once the free flow of spinal 
fluid is obtained, attach the manometer and measure CSF pressure. 
Opening pressure is recorded when the CSF level is steady.

IV.  OTOLARYNGOLOGIC PROCEDURES
A.  Cerumen Impaction Removal4,5
	1.	 Indications: Symptomatic (decreased hearing, pain) and/or assess-
ment of the ear. Clinicians should not routinely disimpact asymptomatic 
patients whose ears can be adequately assessed.
	2.	 Complications: Allergic reaction to cerumenolytics, trauma, earache, diz-
ziness, nystagmus, retention of water, tympanic membrane perforation.
	3.	 Procedures:
	
a.	 Cerumenolytics
	
(1)	 There is no high-­quality evidence suggesting that one cerumeno-
lytic is more effective than another. Water and saline are equally 
as effective as cerumenolytics. There is no difference in efficacy 
between oil-­based and water-­based treatments.
	
(2)	 Avoid hydrogen peroxide; may exacerbate cerumen impaction.
	
(3)	 Apply 5 to 10 eardrops twice daily for no longer than 4 days. Keep 
the head tilted for several minutes for cerumenolytic retention.
	
b.	 Irrigation
	
(1)	 Direct visualization is not necessary.
	
(2)	 Irrigation of the ear canal with a large syringe containing luke-
warm water is equally effective as a commercial mechanical jet 
irrigator.5
	
(3)	 Place a small bucket (e.g., emesis bin) under the patient’s ear to 
collect water.
	
(4)	 Straighten the ear as much as possible by lifting the auricle up 
and posteriorly. Gently apply a continuous stream upwards in the 
canal.
	
(5)	 Note that irrigation is contraindicated in patients with tympanos-
tomy tubes or perforated tympanic membranes, and for remov-
ing vegetables/legumes (increases swelling) and button batteries 
(enhances current flow).
	
c.	 Manual Removal/Instrumentation
	
(1)	 Most useful for cerumen removal in the outer one-­third of the ear.
	
(2)	 Direct visualization is essential, and may render manual removal 
impossible in an uncooperative patient.
	
(3)	 Tools include curettes (plastic or metal), spoons, alligator 
forceps. Do not attempt to break through the cerumen. Advance 
the loop of the curette behind the cerumen and retrieve.
	
d.	 A video on cerumen removal is available on the New England Journal 
of Medicine’s website. 
B.  Foreign Body Removal from Ear6
	1.	 Indications: Retained foreign body in the external auditory canal.
 

--- Page 97 ---
66    Part I  Pediatric Acute Care
	2.	 Contraindications: Urgent referral to an otolaryngologist prior to 
attempted removal is indicated if object is a button battery or penetrat-
ing the ear canal (e.g., pencil, cotton-­tipped swab).
	3.	 Complications: External auditory canal trauma (most common), perfora-
tion of the tympanic membrane, retained foreign object.
	4.	 Procedure:
	
a.	 Insects should be killed with mineral oil, ethanol, or lidocaine prior to 
attempted removal.
	
b.	 Irrigation is useful for hard objects resistant to grasping that are 
nonocclusive.
	
c.	 Instrumentation is most successful for irregularly shaped objects that 
are graspable.
	
d.	 Refer to otolaryngology if removal is unsuccessful.
	5.	 A video on removal of foreign bodies from the ear and nose is available 
on the New England Journal of Medicine’s website. 
C.  Foreign Body Removal from Nose6,7
	1.	 Indications: Retained foreign body in the nasal cavity. Button batteries 
and magnets attached to the nasal septum require urgent removal.
	2.	 Contraindications: Most nasal foreign bodies do not require subspecialty 
referral. Consider otolaryngology referral for posterior objects, button 
batteries, and unsuccessful initial attempts.
	3.	 Complications: Epistaxis, perforation of cribriform plate, retained foreign 
object.
	4.	 Procedure: Lidocaine or any vasoconstrictor (e.g., crushed ice) may be 
used to minimize bleeding and edema.
	
a.	 Self-­Removal: The easiest and least invasive method. Typically, 
only effective for patients older than 3 years. Instruct the patient to 
occlude the unobstructed nostril and blow his/her nose.
	
b.	 Parent Kiss: Provides up to a 60% successful removal rate.
	
(1)	 Instruct the caregiver to place his/her lips around the patient’s 
lips (similar to a “mouth-­to-­mouth” resuscitation breath) and 
occlude the uninvolved nostril with one finger.
	
(2)	 Quickly and forcefully exhale one puff into the child’s mouth. 
This maneuver often expels the foreign body.
	
c.	 High-­Flow Oxygen: Best for foreign bodies that completely occlude 
the anterior nasal cavity. Place suction tubing into the unobstructed 
nostril while the child’s mouth is closed. Deliver 10 to 15 L/min of 
oxygen flow through the tubing.
	
d.	 Instrumentation: Best for foreign bodies that are nonocclusive.
	
(1)	 Equipment: alligator forceps, right-­angle hook, Foley catheter (5 
to 8 Fr), irrigating devices
	
(2)	 Use alligator forceps to extract compressible objects that have 
rough surfaces.
	
(3)	 Use a right-­angle hook for smooth objects that cannot be easily 
grasped.
 

--- Page 98 ---
Chapter 4  Procedures    67

(4)	 Use a Foley catheter for small round objects (e.g., marble). 
Lubricate the catheter, advance the uninflated catheter past the 
object, inflate the catheter balloon, and withdraw the catheter 
and the object. 
D.  Management of Epistaxis6,8
	1.	 Indications: Simple nosebleed. Most cases of epistaxis in children have 
a benign etiology. Referral to an otolaryngologist is only indicated for 
uncontrollable bleeding, posterior epistaxis, hemodynamic instability, 
or anatomic abnormalities (e.g., tumors, polyps). See Chapter 14 for 
management of epistaxis in patients with hemophilia, von Willebrand 
disease, immune thrombocytopenia, or other bleeding disorders.
	2.	 Complications: Persistent bleeding, swallowing blood, toxic shock 
syndrome (from packing material), septal hematomas/abscesses from 
traumatic packing.
	3.	 Procedure: The child should sit upright and bent forward at the waist to 
minimize swallowing blood.
	
a.	 Direct compression: Instruct the child or parent to compress the 
nasal alae together for a minimum of 5 to 10 minutes. Most simple 
bleeds will clot after 5 to 10 minutes.
	
b.	 Topical vasoconstriction: Use oxymetazoline-­soaked cotton pledgets 
or gauze. Phenylephrine is associated with morbidity when used topi-
cally and should be avoided in patients younger than 6 years of age. 
However, if bleeding is refractory to other interventions, the minimum 
dose of phenylephrine needed to cease bleeding should be used. 
Use a squirt bottle or apply the vasoconstrictor on a piece of cotton, 
applying direct pressure on the nose for 5 to 10 minutes.
	
c.	 Nasal packing
	
(1)	 Apply topical anesthetic (4% lidocaine or tetracaine) on a cotton 
pledget and insert into the nasal cavity.
	
(2)	 Rub antibiotic ointment into a quarter-­inch × 72-­inch gauze 
ribbon. Using a nasal speculum or forceps, pack the nasal 
cavity by grasping the gauze ribbon approximately 6 inches 
from its end and placing the packing as far back as possible. 
Ensure that the free end protrudes from the nose and secure 
with tape.
	
(3)	 Maintain packing for 72 hours and prescribe antistaphylococ-
cal antibiotic for 7 to 10 days to minimize risk of toxic shock 
syndrome. If bleeding persists after 72 hours, packing should be 
replaced and the child referred to an otolaryngologist. 
V.  CARDIOVASCULAR PROCEDURES
A.  Vagal Maneuvers for Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)9,10,11
	1.	 Indications: Supraventricular tachycardia, 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) 
block, evaluation of cardiac murmurs.
 

--- Page 99 ---
68    Part I  Pediatric Acute Care
	2.	 Contraindications: Carotid sinus massage is to be avoided in patients 
with prior stroke within the past 3 months or any history of ventricular 
arrhythmia.
	3.	 Complications: Typically transient (resolve within seconds to minutes) 
and include prolonged sinus pause, hypertension (increased intratho-
racic pressure), hypotension (decreased venous return/decrease in 
intrathoracic pressure on exhalation).
	4.	 Procedure:
	
a.	 Cold stimulus to the face: Briefly place an icepack or washcloth 
soaked in ice water on the forehead or bridge of the nose. The ice 
should not be applied for longer than 30 seconds to avoid frostbite.
	
b.	 Valsalva maneuver: Place the patient in supine position and instruct 
to exhale forcefully against a closed glottis. The strain should be 
maintained for 10 to 15 seconds before resuming normal breathing.
	
c.	 Modified Valsalva maneuver: Greater success rate at restoring 
sinus rhythm than standard Valsalva. Place the patient in a semi-­
recumbent position (45-­degree angle), and apply standard Valsalva 
strain. Immediately reposition supine with 15 seconds of passive leg 
raise at a 45-­degree angle.
	
d.	 Carotid sinus massage: Place the patient in a supine position with 
neck extension. Apply steady pressure for 5 to 10 seconds to one 
carotid sinus (inferior to the angle of the mandible where pulsation 
is detected). If unsuccessful, wait 1 to 2 minutes and repeat on the 
contralateral side. 
B.  Heelstick and Fingerstick12
	1.	 Indications: Blood sampling in infants, obtaining point of care whole 
blood samples such as serum glucose
	2.	 Complications: Infection, bleeding, osteomyelitis.
	3.	 Procedure:
	
a.	 Warm heel or finger.
	
b.	 Clean with alcohol.
	
c.	 Using a lancet puncture heel on the lateral aspect, avoiding the 
posterior area, or finger on the distal palmar lateral pad.
	
d.	 Wipe away the first drop of blood, and then collect the sample using 
a capillary tube or container.
	
e.	 Alternate between squeezing blood from the leg toward the heel (or 
from the hand toward the finger) and then releasing the pressure for 
several seconds. 
C.  Peripheral Intravenous Access
	1.	 Indications: Blood sampling and access to peripheral venous circulation 
to deliver fluid, medications, or blood products.
	2.	 Complications: Thrombosis, infection.
	3.	 Procedure:
	
a.	 Apply tourniquet around the extremity proximal to chosen site.
	
b.	 Prepare site with alcohol or chlorhexidine.

c.	 Insert IV catheter, bevel up, at an angle almost parallel to the skin, 
advancing until a flash of blood is seen in the catheter hub. Advance 
the plastic catheter only, remove the needle, and secure the catheter.
	
d.	 After removing tourniquet, attach a syringe and apply gentle negative 
pressure to withdraw blood for serum sampling. Then, attach T con-
nector filled with saline to the catheter, flush with normal saline (NS) 
to ensure patency of the IV line.
	4.	 Ultrasound-­Guided Procedure:
	
a.	 With linear ultrasound probe, identify a vein that does not appear 
to be prohibitively tortuous or stenotic. Perform this by sliding the 
probe along the course of the vessel and identifying its direction and 
branching. The saphenous veins in the calves, veins in the forearms, 
antecubital areas, inside of the upper arms, and external jugular 
veins are areas where ultrasound guidance can help. An ideal vessel 
appears less than 1 cm below the skin surface. Deeper vessels are 
prone to through-­and-­through perforation of the vessel. Infiltration 
around deeper vessels is also a risk, as a shorter length of catheter 
resides in the vessel after insertion.
	
b.	 Prepare the site, and in the case of limb vessels, place a tourniquet 
proximal to the insertion site.
	
c.	 Under ultrasound visualization, insert the needle into the skin at a 
shallow (usually <30 degrees) angle to the skin at the midline of the 
probe near where it contacts the skin. With the probe visualizing the 
vessel transversely, slowly advance the needle and follow the tip of 
the needle by sliding the probe away from you. Advance the ultra-
sound probe until the needle punctures the vessel wall.
	
d.	 Proceed with cannulation of the vessel and secure the intravenous 
catheter per standard procedure.
	5.	 Infiltration and Extravasation13: Common injury secondary to fluid infu-
sion into subcutaneous tissues around the venipuncture site. Typically 
occurs due to puncture of the vein or if the catheter slips out of the vein. 
The difference between infiltration and extravasation is the type of fluid 
that has leaked (nonvesicant vs. vesicant). Infiltrations are generally 
benign, although they can still inflict damage via exertion of mechani-
cal forces on surrounding structures. Extravasation due to a vesicant 
can cause blistering and burns, leading to necrosis of the tissue. To 
determine if infiltration/extravasation has occurred, firmly occlude the 
vein 1 to 2 inches proximal to the insertion site. Continued infusion with-
out resistance indicates infiltration. Immediately stop the infusion. Refer 
to institutional policy for guidelines regarding application of medication 
(e.g., hyaluronidase, phentolamine, nitroglycerin ointment). Elevate the 
affected limb to reduce swelling; apply a warm compress for 10 to 15 
minutes; encourage movement of the affected arm. Reevaluate the site 
every 8 hours.

Journal of Medicine’s website.

D.  External Jugular Puncture and Catheterization (see Section XI, 
Online Content)
E.  Radial Artery Puncture and Catheterization2,3
	1.	 Indications: Arterial blood sampling or frequent blood gas and continu-
ous blood pressure monitoring in an intensive care setting.
	2.	 Complications: Infection, bleeding, occlusion of artery by hematoma or 
thrombosis, ischemia if ulnar circulation is inadequate.
	3.	 Procedure:
	
a.	 Before the procedure, test adequacy of ulnar blood flow with the 
Allen test: Clench the hand while simultaneously compressing ulnar 
and radial arteries. The hand will blanch. Release pressure from the 
ulnar artery, and observe the flushing response. Procedure is safe to 
perform if the entire hand flushes.
	
b.	 Locate the radial pulse. It is optional to infiltrate the area over the 
point of maximal impulse with lidocaine. Avoid infusion into the ves-
sel by aspirating before infusing. Prepare the site in a sterile fashion.
	
c.	 Puncture: Insert a butterfly needle attached to a syringe at a 30-­ to 
60-­degree angle over the point of maximal impulse. Blood should 
flow freely into the syringe in a pulsatile fashion. Suction may be 
required for plastic tubes. Once the sample is obtained, apply firm, 
constant pressure for 5 minutes and then place a pressure dressing 
on the puncture site.
	
d.	 Catheter placement: Secure the patient’s hand to an arm board. 
Leave the fingers exposed to observe any color changes. Prepare the 
wrist with sterile technique and infiltrate over the point of maximal 
impulse with 1% lidocaine. Insert an IV catheter with its needle at a 
30-­degree angle to the horizontal until a flash of blood is seen in the 
catheter hub. Advance the plastic catheter and remove the needle. 
Alternatively, pass the needle and catheter through the artery to trans-
fix it, and then withdraw the needle. Very slowly, withdraw the catheter 
until free flow of blood is noted, then advance the catheter and secure 
in place using sutures or tape. Seldinger technique (Fig. 4.2) using a 
guidewire can also be used. Apply a sterile dressing and infuse hepa-
rinized isotonic fluid (per institutional protocol) at a minimum of 1 mL/
hr. A pressure transducer may be attached to monitor blood pressure.
	
e.	 Suggested size of arterial catheters based on weight:
	
(1)	 Infant (<10 kg): 24 G or 2.5 Fr, 2.5 cm
	
(2)	 Child (10 to 40 kg): 22 G or 2.4 Fr, 2.5 cm
	
(3)	 Adolescent (>40 kg): 20 G
	4.	 Ultrasound-­Guided Procedure
	
a.	 Use the linear probe. After the sterile field has been prepped, apply 
gel to the probe and place within a sterile cover. Place the ultra-
sound probe transverse to the artery on the radial, posterior tibial, or

dorsalis pedis pulse. Identify the artery, which will appear pulsatile 
with some compression. Once the artery has been identified, center 
the probe over the vessel (Fig. 4.3). Insert the needle into the skin at 
a 45-­degree angle at the midline of the probe near where it contacts 
the skin. With the probe visualizing the vessel transversely, slowly

advance the needle and follow the tip of the needle by sliding the 
probe away. Advance the ultrasound probe until the needle punc-
tures the vessel wall. Proceed with the rest of the procedure after 
vessel puncture, as described previously.
	5.	 Videos on arterial puncture and radial artery catheterization are available 
on the New England Journal of Medicine’s website.
	6.	 A video on ultrasound-­guided radial artery catheterization is available on 
the New England Journal of Medicine’s website. 
F.  Posterior Tibial and Dorsalis Pedis Artery Puncture
	1.	 Indications: Arterial blood sampling when radial artery puncture is 
unsuccessful or inaccessible.
	2.	 Complications: Infection, bleeding, ischemia if circulation is inadequate.
	3.	 Procedure:
	
a.	 Posterior tibial artery: Puncture the artery posterior to medial mal-
leolus while holding the foot in dorsiflexion.
	
b.	 Dorsalis pedis artery: Puncture the artery at dorsal midfoot between 
first and second toes while holding the foot in plantar flexion. 
G.  Intraosseous (IO) Access2,3 (Fig. 4.4)
	1.	 Indications: Obtain emergency access in children during life-­threatening 
situations. This is very useful during cardiopulmonary arrest, shock, 
burns, and life-­threatening status epilepticus. Any crystalloid, blood 
product, or drug that may be infused into a peripheral vein may also 
be infused into the IO space. The IO needle should be removed once 
adequate vascular access has been established. Insertion of IO needle 
into fractured bones should be avoided.
	2.	 Complications:
	
a.	 Complications are rare, particularly with the correct technique. 
Frequency of complications increases with prolonged infusions.

b.	 Complications include extravasation of fluid from incomplete or 
through and through cortex penetration, infection, bleeding, osteo-
myelitis, compartment syndrome, fat embolism, fracture, epiphyseal 
injury.
	3.	 Sites of entry (in order of preference):
	
a.	 Anteromedial surface of the proximal tibia, 2 cm below and 1 to 2 
cm medial to the tibial tuberosity on the flat part of the bone.
	
b.	 Distal femur 3 cm above the lateral condyle in the midline.
	
c.	 Medial surface of the distal tibia 1 to 2 cm above the medial mal-
leolus (may be a more effective site in older children).
	
d.	 Proximal humerus, 2 cm below the acromion process into the greater 
tubercle with the arm held in adduction and internal rotation.
	
e.	 Anterosuperior iliac spine at a 90-­degree angle to the long axis of the 
body.
	4.	 Procedure:
	
a.	 Prepare the selected site in a sterile fashion.
	
b.	 If the child is conscious, anesthetize the puncture site down to the 
periosteum with 1% lidocaine (optional in emergency situations).
	
c.	 Choose between a manual IO or drill-­powered IO insertion device:
	
(1)	 For manual IO needle: Insert a 15-­ to 18-­gauge IO needle per-
pendicular to the skin at an angle away from the epiphyseal plate, 
and advance to the periosteum. With a boring rotary motion, pen-
etrate through the cortex until there is a decrease in resistance, 
indicating that you have reached the marrow. The needle should 
stand firmly without support. Secure the needle carefully.
	
(2)	 For drill-­powered IO needle: Enter skin with the needle perpen-
dicular to the skin, as with the manual needle, and press the 
needle until you meet the periosteum. Then apply easy pressure

while gently depressing the drill trigger until you feel a decrease 
in resistance. Remove the drill while holding the needle steady 
to ensure stability prior to securing the needle. Use an EZ-­IO AD 
for patients greater than 40 kg, and use EZ-­IO PD for patients 
greater than 6 kg and less than 40 kg.
	
d.	 Remove the stylet and attempt to aspirate marrow. (Note that it is 
not necessary to aspirate marrow.) Flush with crystalloid solution. 
Observe for fluid extravasation. Marrow can be sent to determine glu-
cose levels, chemistries, blood types and cross-­matches, hemoglobin 
levels, blood gas analyses, and cultures.
	
e.	 Attach standard IV tubing. Increased pressure (through pressure 
bag or push) may be necessary for infusion. There is a high risk 
for obstruction if continuous high-­pressure fluids are not flushed 
through the IO needle.
	5.	 A video on IO catheter placement is available on the New England Journal 
of Medicine’s website. 
H.  Umbilical Artery and Umbilical Vein Catheterization2
	1.	 Indications: Vascular access (via umbilical vein [UV]), blood pressure 
monitoring (via umbilical artery [UA]), or blood gas monitoring (via UA) 
in critically ill neonates.
	2.	 Complications: Infection, bleeding, hemorrhage, perforation of vessel, 
thrombosis with distal embolization, ischemia or infarction of lower extrem-
ities, bowel, or kidney, arrhythmia if catheter is in the heart, air embolus.
	3.	 Contraindications: Omphalitis, peritonitis, possible/confirmed necrotizing 
enterocolitis, intestinal hypoperfusion.
	4.	 Line placement:
	
a.	 Umbilical arterial catheter (UAC) line: Low line vs. high line.
	
(1)	 Low line: Tip of catheter should lie just above the aortic bifurca-
tion between L3 and L5. This avoids renal and mesenteric arter-
ies near L1, possibly decreasing the incidence of thrombosis or 
ischemia.
	
(2)	 High line: Tip of catheter should be above the diaphragm 
between T6 and T9. A high line may be recommended in infants 
weighing less than 750 g, in whom a low line could easily slip 
out.
	
b.	 Umbilical venous catheter (UVC) lines should be placed in the infe-
rior vena cava above the level of the ductus venosus and the hepatic 
veins and below the level of the right atrium.
	
c.	 Catheter length: Determine the length of catheter required using 
either a standardized graph based on shoulder-­umbilical length or 
the following birth weight (BW) regression formula:
	
(1)	 UAC Low Line (cm) = BW (kg) × 7
	
(2)	 UAC High Line (cm) = (3 × BW (kg)) + 9
	
(3)	 UVC Length (cm) = 0.5 × UAC high line (cm) + 1.
	5.	 Procedure for UAC line (Fig. 4.5):
 

--- Page 106 ---
Chapter 4  Procedures    75
4
	
a.	 Determine the length of the catheter to be inserted for either high (T6 
to T9) or low (L3 to L5) position.
	
b.	 Restrain infant. Maintain the infant’s temperature during the proce-
dure. Prepare and drape the umbilical cord and adjacent skin using 
sterile technique.
	
c.	 Flush the catheter with sterile saline solution before insertion. Ensure 
that there are no air bubbles in the catheter or attached syringe.
	
d.	 Place sterile umbilical tape around the base of the cord. Cut through 
the cord horizontally about 1.5 to 2 cm from the skin; tighten the 
umbilical tape to prevent bleeding.
	
e.	 Identify the one large, thin-­walled UV and two smaller, thick-­walled 
arteries. Use one tip of open, curved forceps to gently probe and 
dilate one artery. Then use both points of closed forceps, and dilate 
artery by allowing forceps to open gently.

f.	 Grasp the catheter 1 cm from its tip with toothless forceps and 
insert the catheter into the lumen of the artery. Aim the tip toward 
the feet and gently advance the catheter to the desired distance. Do 
not force. If resistance is encountered, try loosening umbilical tape, 
applying steady and gentle pressure, or manipulating the angle of the 
umbilical cord to the skin. Often the catheter cannot be advanced 
because of the creation of a “false luminal tract.” There should be 
good blood return when the catheter enters the iliac artery.
	
g.	 Confirm catheter tip position with x-­ray or ultrasound. Secure 
catheter with a suture through the cord, a marker tape, and a tape 
bridge. The catheter may be pulled back but not advanced once the 
sterile field is broken.
	
h.	 Observe for complications: Blanching or cyanosis of lower extremi-
ties, perforation, thrombosis, embolism, or infection. If any complica-
tions occur, the catheter should be removed.
	
i.	 Use isotonic fluids containing heparin per institutional policy. Never 
use hypoosmolar fluids in the UA.
	6.	 Procedure for UVC line (see Fig. 4.5):
	
a.	 Determine the desired length and follow steps “a” through “d” for 
UA catheter placement.
	
b.	 Isolate the thin-­walled UV, clear thrombi with forceps, and insert 
catheter, aiming the tip toward the right shoulder. Gently advance 
the catheter to the desired distance. Do not force. If resistance is 
encountered, try loosening the umbilical tape, applying steady and 
gentle pressure, or manipulating the angle of the umbilical cord to 
the skin. Resistance is commonly met at the abdominal wall and 
again at the portal system. Do not infuse anything into the liver.
	
c.	 Confirm catheter tip position with x-­ray or ultrasound. Secure 
catheter with a suture through the cord, a marker tape, and a tape 
bridge. The catheter may be pulled back but not advanced once the 
sterile field is broken.
	7.	 A video on UVC/UAC line placement is available on the New England 
Journal of Medicine’s website. 
VI.  PULMONARY PROCEDURES
A.  Use of Metered-­Dose Inhalers and Spacer6
	1.	 Indications: Delivery of medication to distal airways in the lungs.
	2.	 Complications: Failure of medication delivery. Note that there are risks 
associated with the medication rather than the delivery method.
	3.	 Procedure:
	
a.	 Shake the inhaler, remove the cap, and attach it to the spacer device.
	
b.	 Instruct the child to exhale completely.
	
c.	 Place the mouthpiece of the spacer into the patient’s mouth, and 
instruct the child to make a complete seal with the lips. Alternatively, 
a spacer with a mask can be placed over the child’s mouth if they 
are unable to make a seal with their lips.
 

--- Page 108 ---
Chapter 4  Procedures    77

d.	 Spray 1 puff from the inhaler into the spacer and instruct the patient 
to breathe slowly and deeply, holding the breath for 10 seconds.
	
e.	 Wait 1 minute and repeat as indicated. 
B.  Needle Cricothyrotomy6,14
	1.	 Indications: When an emergency airway is required and the clinician 
is unable to use bag-­mask ventilation or secure an orotracheal or 
nasotracheal airway. Common indications include facial fractures, blood 
or vomitus in the airway, airway obstruction (e.g., foreign body, tumor, 
edema from trauma).
	2.	 Contraindications: No absolute contraindications. Relative contraindi-
cations include unable to locate landmarks, laryngotracheal damage, 
coagulopathy, bleeding dyscrasia.
	3.	 Complications: Bleeding, hypoxia, pneumothorax, esophageal lacera-
tion, vocal cord injury, posterior tracheal wall perforation, infection.
	4.	 Procedure:
	
a.	 Immobilize the larynx with the nondominant hand and identify the 
cricothyroid membrane. This is located by palpating the laryngeal 
prominence at midline of the thyroid cartilage and then moving 
distally 1 to 2 cm to a small depression. This depression overlies the 
cricothyroid membrane.
	
b.	 Insert a 12 to 14-­gauge angiocatheter caudally at a 30-­ to 45-­degree 
angle through the cricothyroid membrane while aspirating the needle 
as it is inserted.
	
c.	 Attach the needle to an oxygen source that can deliver roughly 30 
psi. Alternatively, a bag-­valve device can be connected using a 7.0 
endotracheal tube adapter and a 3 mL syringe with plunger removed.
	
d.	 Intermittent ventilation can be achieved by cutting a small hole in the 
oxygen tubing, and covering the hole in the tubing. Allow for expira-
tion by uncovering the hole for 4 to 10 seconds. 
C.  Needle Thoracostomy2,15
	1.	 Indications: Evacuation of a pneumothorax, hemothorax, chylotho-
rax, large pleural effusion, or empyema for diagnostic or therapeutic 
purposes.
	2.	 Complications: Infection, bleeding, pneumothorax, hemothorax, pulmo-
nary contusion or laceration, puncture of diaphragm, spleen, or liver, or 
bronchopleural fistula.
	3.	 Procedure:
	
a.	 Prepare and drape the skin as clean as possible, with goal of sterility.
	
b.	 Insert a large-­bore angiocatheter (14-­ to 22-­gauge based on patient 
size and likely depth of the chest wall) into the anterior second inter-
costal space in the midclavicular line. Insert needle over superior 
aspect of rib margin to avoid neurovascular structures. If the angio-
catheter permits, a 3-­ to 10-­mL syringe with 1 to 2 mL of saline can 
be connected to it. Aspirating the syringe while inserting the IV will 
pull air bubbles through the saline if an air collection exists. A rush of 
bubbles signifies successful access.
 

--- Page 109 ---
78    Part I  Pediatric Acute Care
	
c.	 When pleural space is entered, withdraw needle and attach catheter 
to a three-­way stopcock and syringe, and aspirate air. The stopcock 
is used to stop air flow through the catheter when sufficient evacua-
tion has been performed.
	
d.	 Subsequent insertion of a chest tube is often necessary for ongoing 
release of air. It is advised not to completely evacuate chest prior to 
placement of chest tube to avoid pleural injury.
	4.	 A video on needle decompression of spontaneous pneumothorax is avail-
able on the New England Journal of Medicine’s website. 
VII.  GASTROINTESTINAL PROCEDURES
A.  Nasogastric Tube Placement6,16
	1.	 Indications: Enteral nutrition, administration of medications, treatment of 
ileus or obstruction, gastric decompression.
	2.	 Contraindications: Esophageal stricture, esophageal varices, severe mid-
face trauma (cribriform plate disruption), bleeding diatheses, alkaline 
ingestion.
	3.	 Complications: Malposition, coiling of tube, esophageal perforation, 
pneumothorax.
	4.	 Procedure:
	
a.	 Approximate the length of 6-­ to 10-­Fr tube insertion by positioning 
the tube from the nares or mouth to the ear, then to the mid-­xyphoid-­
umbilicus. Mark this length on the tube with marker.
	
b.	 The patient should be sitting as upright as possible. The head should 
be tilted toward the chest.
	
c.	 Lubricate the tube and insert the tube through the nose. Advance 
the tube to the length mark, asking the patient to swallow while the 
tube is inserted. It may be helpful to provide a cup of water with a 
straw.
	
d.	 Confirm placement of the tube with a radiograph of the lower chest/
upper abdomen. Ensure that the tube is located distal to the carina, 
crosses the diaphragm, and rests in a central position in the gastric 
region. The tube should not cross the midline. Additional confirma-
tion can be obtained by testing the pH of aspirated contents. A of 
pH 1 to 4 confirms proper positioning. Alternatively, insert a small 
amount of air (20 to 30 mL) through the tube while listening to the 
gastric area with a stethoscope.
	
e.	 Secure the tube. 
B.  Gastrostomy Tube Replacement6,17
	1.	 Indications: Dislodged, blocked, or replacement of gastrostomy tube 
(G-­tube) or gastrostomy button.
	2.	 Complications: Perforation, bleeding, pneumoperitoneum, creation of 
“false track” particularly if tube is newly placed. Note that misplacement 
and associated complications are rare for children with a mature G-­tube 
track undergoing tube replacement in a pediatric emergency room.

	3.	 Procedure:
	
a.	 Deflate balloon completely with a syringe and pull the tube out 
steadily.
	
b.	 Insert new tube in the stoma and inflate balloon fully with water. 
Gently tug on the tube to assess whether the balloon is inflated. 
Secure the tube.
	
c.	 Confirm intragastric placement by aspirating gastric contents.
	
d.	 If replacement tube is not immediately available, a Foley catheter of simi-
lar size may be placed using the method above to maintain tract patency.
	
e.	 If the G-­tube track is too constricted for placement of G-­tube, con-
sider upsizing with Foley catheter serial dilation.

Journal of Medicine’s website. 
VIII.  GENITOURINARY PROCEDURES
A.  Urinary Bladder Catheterization3,6,18
	1.	 Indications: To obtain urine for urinalysis and sterile culture, to accu-
rately monitor hydration status, and bladder decompression.
	2.	 Complications: Hematuria, infection, trauma to urethra or bladder, intra-
vesical knot of catheter (rarely occurs).
	3.	 Contraindications: Pelvic fractures, known trauma to the urethra, or 
blood at the meatus.
	4.	 Catheter Selection: 5 Fr for children younger than 6 months; 8 Fr for 
children between 6 months and adolescence; 10 Fr for adolescents.
	5.	 Procedure:
	
a.	 For collection of urinalysis and/or urine culture, the infant/child 
should not have voided within 1 hour of procedure.
	
b.	 Prepare the urethral opening using sterile technique.
	
c.	 In males, apply gentle traction to the penis to straighten the urethra. 
In uncircumcised male infants, expose the meatus with gentle retrac-
tion of the foreskin. The foreskin has to be retracted only far enough 
to visualize the meatus.
	
d.	 In girls, the urethral orifice may be difficult to visualize, but it is usu-
ally immediately superoanterior to the vaginal orifice.
	
e.	 Gently insert a lubricated catheter into the urethra. Slowly advance 
catheter until resistance is met at the external sphincter. Continued 
pressure will overcome this resistance, and the catheter will enter 
the bladder. Only a few centimeters of advancement are required to 
reach the bladder in girls. In boys, insert a few centimeters longer 
than the shaft of the penis.
	
f.	 Carefully remove the catheter once specimen is obtained, and 
cleanse skin of iodine.
	
g.	 If indwelling Foley catheter is inserted, inflate balloon with sterile 
water or saline as indicated on bulb, then connect catheter to drain-
age tubing attached to urine drainage bag. Secure catheter tubing to 
inner thigh.

	6.	 Videos on catheterization of the male urethra and catheterization of the 
female urethra are available on the New England Journal of Medicine’s 
website. 
B.  Suprapubic Bladder Aspiration2
	1.	 Indications: To obtain urine in a sterile manner for urinalysis and culture 
in children younger than 2 years (avoid in children with genitourinary 
tract anomalies, coagulopathy, or intestinal obstruction). This bypasses 
distal urethra, thereby minimizing risk for contamination.
	2.	 Complications: Infection (cellulitis), hematuria (usually microscopic), 
intestinal perforation.
	3.	 Procedure (Fig. 4.6):
	
a.	 Anterior rectal pressure in girls or gentle penile pressure in boys may 
be used to prevent urination during the procedure. Child should not 
have voided within 1 hour of procedure.
	
b.	 Restrain child in the supine, frog leg position. Prepare suprapubic 
area in a sterile fashion.
	
c.	 The site for puncture is 1 to 2 cm above the symphysis pubis in the 
midline. Use a syringe with a 22-­gauge, 1-­inch needle, and puncture 
at a 10-­ to 20-­degree angle to the perpendicular, aiming slightly 
caudad.
	
d.	 Ultrasound guidance:
	
(1)	 Ultrasound can be used to visualize the urinary bladder for this 
procedure as follows: Use the curvilinear or linear probe. Apply 
the probe in transverse position in the midline of the lower abdo-
men, positioning it to locate the bladder. The bladder is a midline 
structure with a dark center and bright margins. The shape of 
the bladder is usually rounded; however, it can appear spherical, 
pyramidal, or even cuboidal (Fig. 4.7).
	
(2)	 The bladder may be empty as well with no dark cavity. If no clear 
structure, give fluids and reassess in 30 minutes. This technique 
can also be used in the evaluation of anuric patients, to differen-
tiate between decreased urine production and urinary retention. 
This is also useful in the case of patients with a urinary catheter 
as the catheter is usually visible. If it is visualized and the blad-
der also has urine around it, the catheter is likely malfunctioning.
	
(3)	 Aspiration can be performed after marking the site with ultra-
sound, proceeding with preparing and draping the patient and 
proceeding to puncture.
	
e.	 Gently exert suction as the needle is advanced until urine enters 
syringe. The needle should not be advanced more than 3 cm. 
Aspirate urine with gentle suction.
	
f.	 Remove needle, cleanse skin of iodine, and apply a sterile bandage.
	4.	 A video of suprapubic bladder aspiration is available on the New England 
Journal of Medicine’s website.

IX.  MUSCULOSKELETAL PROCEDURES
A.  Basic Splinting2
	1.	 Indications: To provide short-­term stabilization of limb injuries while 
accommodating swelling associated with acute injuries.
	2.	 Complications: Pressure sores, dermatitis, neurovascular impairment.
	3.	 Procedure:
	
a.	 Determine style of splint needed (see Section IX.B).
	
b.	 Measure and cut fiberglass or plaster to appropriate length. If using 
plaster, upper-­extremity splints require 8 to 10 layers and lower-­
extremity splints require 12 to 14 layers.
	
c.	 Pad extremity with copious cotton roll padding, taking care to overlap 
each turn by 50%. In prepackaged fiberglass splints, additional 
padding is not generally required. Bony prominences may require 
additional padding. Place cotton between digits if they are in a splint.
	
d.	 Immerse plaster slabs into room temperature water until bubbling 
stops. Smooth out wet plaster slab, avoiding any wrinkles. Fiberglass 
splints will harden when exposed to air; however, application of a 
small amount of room temperature water can accelerate this process.
	
e.	 Position splint over extremity and mold to desired contour. Wrap with 
an elastic bandage to hold molded splint onto extremity in position of 
PELVIS
FIGURE 4.7
Ultrasound of bladder. In this transverse midline view of the pelvis the bladder appears 
black (anechoic) and cuboid in the midline. This is the typical appearance of a full blad-
der on ultrasound, although the shape may vary. (From Leeson K, Leeson B. Pediatric 
ultrasound: applications in the emergency department. Emerg Med Clin North Am. 
2013;31(3):809–829.)

function. Continue to hold desired form of splint upon extremity until 
fully hardened.
	
f.	 NOTE: Plaster becomes warm while drying. Using warm water will 
decrease drying time. This may result in inadequate time to mold 
splint. Turn edge of the splint back on itself to produce a smooth 
surface. Take care to cover the sharp edges of fiberglass.
	
g.	 Use crutches or slings as indicated.
	
h.	 The need for orthopedic referral should be individually assessed.
	
i.	 Emergent orthopedic referral may be required, including when there 
is concern for neurovascular compromise or compartment syndrome 
of the affected extremity.
	4.	 Postsplint Care:
	
a.	 Standard rest, ice, and elevation of affected extremity should be 
performed.
	
b.	 Avoid weight bearing on splinted extremity.
	
c.	 Do not get splint wet. Splints can be wrapped in water-­resistant items 
such as a plastic bag or a specially designed splint bag to allow for 
showering. Use a hair dryer in instances where the splint has acci-
dentally gotten wet.
	
d.	 Do not stick items such as a pen or clothes hanger to scratch inside 
the splint.
	
e.	 If areas in or distal to the splint develop numbness, tingling, increased 
pain, turn blue or pale, or become swollen, patient should loosen the 
elastic bandage of the splint. Instruct to seek immediate medical care 
if this does not quickly (<30 minutes) resolve these symptoms.
	5.	 A video on basic splinting techniques is available on the New England 
Journal of Medicine’s website. 
B.  Selected Splints and Indications (Fig. 4.8)
	1.	 Long Arm Posterior Splint
	
a.	 Indications: Immobilization of elbow and forearm injuries.
	
b.	 Procedure: Elbow flexed at 90 degrees, forearm in neutral position, 
slight dorsiflexion of the wrist. Splint extends from palmar crease of 
the hand to mid upper arm along the ulnar side of the forearm and the 
posterior aspect of the humerus. Width should be semicircumferential.
	2.	 Sugar Tong Forearm Splint
	
a.	 Indications: For distal radius and wrist fractures; to immobilize the 
elbow and minimize pronation and supination.
	
b.	 Procedure: Elbow flexed at 90 degrees, forearm in neutral position, 
and slight dorsiflexion of the wrist. Splint extends from palmar crease 
along volar aspect of forearm, around elbow, and dorsally to the 
metacarpals. Fingers and thumb remain free. Width should support 
arm on both sides but not overlap.
	3.	 Ulnar Gutter Splint
	
a.	 Indications: Nonrotated fourth or fifth (boxer) metacarpal metaphy-
seal fracture with less than 20 degrees of angulation, uncomplicated 
fourth and fifth phalangeal fracture.

b.	 Assess for malrotation, displacement (especially Salter I type frac-
ture), angulation, and joint stability before splinting.
	
c.	 Procedure: Elbow in neutral position, wrist in slight dorsiflexion, 
metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint at 60 to 90 degrees, interpha-
langeal (IP) joint at 20 degrees. Apply splint in U shape from the 
tip of the fifth digit to 3 cm distal to the volar crease of the elbow. 
Splint should be wide enough to enclose the fourth and fifth 
digits.
	4.	 Thumb Spica Splint
	
a.	 Indications: Nonrotated, nonangulated, nonarticular fractures of the 
thumb metacarpal or phalanx, ulnar collateral ligament injury (game-
keeper’s or skier’s thumb), scaphoid fracture or suspected scaphoid 
fracture (pain in anatomic snuff box).
	
b.	 Procedure: Wrist in slight dorsiflexion, thumb in some flexion and 
abduction, IP joint in slight flexion. Apply splint in U shape along 
radial side of forearm extending from tip of thumb to mid-­forearm. 
Mold the splint along the long axis of the thumb so that thumb 
position is maintained. This will result in a spiral configuration along 
the forearm with maintained apposition of the index finger and 
thumb.
	5.	 Volar Splint
	
a.	 Indications: Wrist immobilization for wrist sprains, strains, or certain 
fractures.
	
b.	 Procedure: Wrist in slight dorsiflexion. Apply splint on palmar surface 
from the MP joint to 2 to 3 cm distal to the volar crease of the elbow. 
It is useful to curve the splint to allow the MP joint to rest at an 80-­ to 
90-­degree angle.
	6.	 Posterior Ankle Splint
	
a.	 Indications: Immobilization of ankle sprains and fractures of the foot, 
ankle, and distal fibula.
	
b.	 Procedure: Place patient in prone position with ipsilateral knee flexed 
at 90 degrees and affected ankle held in flexion at 90 degrees. Splint 
should extend from base of toes to upper portion of the calf. Width 
should match that of the foot. An ankle stirrup (sugar tong) splint can 
be added to increase stability for ankle fractures.
	7.	 Ankle Stirrup Splint
	
a.	 Indications: Immobilization of the ankle.
	
b.	 Procedure: Ankle held in flexion at 90 degrees. Splint extends in 
U-­shaped fashion from fibular head underneath the ankle to just 
below the knee. Width should be one half of the narrowest circumfer-
ence of the lower leg and not overlapping. May be used alone or in 
combination with (placed after) posterior ankle splint. 
C.  Radial Head Subluxation (Nursemaid’s Elbow) Reduction19
	1.	 Presentation: Commonly occurs in children aged 1 to 4 years with a 
history of inability to use an arm after it was pulled. Child presents with 
affected arm held at the side in pronation, with elbow slightly flexed.
 

--- Page 117 ---
86    Part I  Pediatric Acute Care
	2.	 Caution: Rule out a fracture clinically before doing procedure. Consider 
radiograph if mechanism of injury or history is atypical or if exam is 
concerning for fracture (swelling, bruising, tenderness, etc.).
	3.	 Procedure:
	
a.	 Two most common techniques include hyperpronation (HP) and 
traditional supination-­flexion (SF) maneuvers. Recent meta-­analyses 
of randomized trials evaluating the two techniques favor HP for both 
efficacy and pain tolerance.
	
b.	 Support the elbow with one hand, and place your thumb laterally 
over the radial head at the elbow applying pressure medially. With 
your other hand, grasp the child’s hand in a handshake position or at 
the wrist. The child’s thumb should point downward.
	
c.	 HP method: Forcefully pronate the wrist. You may feel a click as 
reduction occurs.
	
d.	 SF method: Quickly and deliberately supinate and externally rotate 
the forearm, and simultaneously flex the elbow.
	
e.	 Most children will begin to use the arm within 15 minutes, some 
immediately after reduction. If reduction occurs after a prolonged 
period of subluxation, it may take the child longer to recover use of 
the arm. In this case, the arm should be immobilized with a posterior 
splint.
	
f.	 If procedure is unsuccessful, consider obtaining a radiograph. 
Maneuver may be repeated if needed.
	4.	 A video on reduction of nursemaid’s elbow is available on the New 
England Journal of Medicine’s website. 
D.  Finger/Toe Dislocation Reduction2
	1.	 Indications: IP and MP/metatarsophalangeal dislocations.
	2.	 Complications: Fracture of phalanges, entrapment of neurovascular 
structures.
	3.	 Cautions: Volar dislocations and dorsal dislocations with interposition of 
the volar plate or entrapment of the metacarpal/metatarsal head often 
cannot be performed using closed reduction.
	4.	 Procedure:
	
a.	 Evaluate for neurovascular compromise in the affected digit. Perform 
radiographs to evaluate for possible fracture.
	
b.	 Consider procedural sedation or a digital block prior to procedure.
	
c.	 Grasp the digit proximal to fracture to allow for stabilization.
	
d.	 Grasp the tip of the distal digit and apply longitudinal traction, with 
the joint typically slipping into place.
	
e.	 Alternatively, grasp the distal phalanx and mildly hyperextend to 
accentuate the deformity while applying longitudinal traction.
	
f.	 After reduction, again evaluate neurovascular status and obtain 
radiographs to ensure proper position and to further evaluate for 
fracture.
	
g.	 Immobilize the joint using a padded splint using full extension for 
distal IP joints and 20 to 30 degrees of flexion for proximal IP joints.

E.  Knee Arthrocentesis2
	1.	 Indications: Evaluation of fluid for the diagnosis of disease, including 
infectious, inflammatory, and crystalline disease, and removal of fluid for 
relief of pain and/or functional limitation.
	2.	 Contraindications: Bleeding diathesis, local fracture, overlying skin 
infection.
	3.	 Complications: Pain, bleeding, infection.
	4.	 Procedure:
	
a.	 Place child supine on exam table with knee in slight flexion, with use of 
a padded roll underneath the knee for support, if unable to slightly flex.
	
b.	 The lateral or medial approach can be made, with the lateral 
approach preferred to avoid the vastus medialis muscle.
	
c.	 The puncture point should be at the posterior margin of the patella in 
both cases.
	
d.	 Prepare the overlying skin in a sterile fashion, and once cleaned, numb 
the area using 1% lidocaine with a small-­gauge needle. Then, using an 
18-­gauge needle attached to a syringe, puncture the skin at a 10-­ to 
20-­degree downward angle, and advance under continuous syringe 
suction until fluid is withdrawn, indicating entry into the joint space.
	
e.	 In large effusions, several syringes may be needed for complete fluid 
removal if so desired, and the needle may have to be redirected to 
access pockets of fluid.
	
f.	 Upon completion, withdraw the needle and cover the wound with a 
sterile gauze dressing.
	
g.	 Synovial fluid can then be sent for studies as indicated.
	5.	 A video on knee arthrocentesis is available on the New England Journal 
of Medicine’s website. 
F.  Hematoma Blocks20
	1.	 Indications: Analgesia for closed fracture of the extremity that requires 
manipulation or closed reduction. It is an alternative when procedural 
sedation is not possible or is impractical.
	2.	 Contraindications: Allergic reactions to local anesthetic agents, open 
fracture, cellulitis overlying fracture site, presence of a neurovascular 
deficit or vascular deficit.
	3.	 Complications: Rare, but include compartment syndrome, local anes-
thetic toxicity (circumoral and tongue numbness, dizziness, tinnitus, 
and visual disturbances), and osteomyelitis.
	4.	 Procedure:
	
a.	 Perform using aseptic technique.
	
b.	 Draw up the local anesthetic solution into a syringe with a 22-­ or 
23-­gauge, 2-­inch-­long needle. Bupivacaine, for postprocedure anal-
gesia, is desired and can be used alone or mixed with lidocaine in a 
50:50 ratio. (See Chapter 6 for dosage maximum.)
	
c.	 Place a wheal of 1% lidocaine subcutaneously over the fracture site. 
Allow 1 to 2 minutes for the anesthetic to take effect.
 

--- Page 119 ---
88    Part I  Pediatric Acute Care
	
d.	 Slowly insert and advance the needle attached to the local anesthetic 
solution through the skin wheal and aimed at the fracture site. C-­arm 
fluoroscopy can aid fracture/hematoma localization. Slowly advance 
the needle.
	
(1)	 Aspirate with the syringe to ensure there is no free flow of blood, 
which indicates that the needle is within a blood vessel. If there 
is free blood flow, do not inject the local anesthetic solution.
	
(2)	 A flash, without flow, of blood indicates entry of the tip of the 
needle into the hematoma.
	
(3)	 Redirect needle if you strike bone or if no flash of blood is 
returned.
	
e.	 Once flash, without flow, is obtained, slowly inject the local anesthetic 
solution into the hematoma.
	
f.	 Reposition the needle to different areas within the hematoma and 
inject small amounts of the local anesthetic into each area. This 
technique distributes the local anesthetic solution to increase the 
efficacy of the hematoma block and minimizes the risk of intravascu-
lar injection of the entire dose of local anesthetic.
	
g.	 Withdraw the needle, apply a bandage to the skin puncture site, and 
await analgesia. 
X.  SKIN/DERMATOLOGIC PROCEDURES
A.  Immunization and Medication Administration3
NOTE: Please see Chapters 16 and 30 for relevant vaccines and medica-
tions and their appropriate administration routes.
	1.	 Subcutaneous Injections
	
a.	 Indications: Immunizations and medications.
	
b.	 Complications: Bleeding, infection, allergic reaction, lipohypertrophy 
or lipoatrophy after repeated injections.
	
c.	 Procedure:
	
(1)	 Locate injection site: Upper outer arm or outer aspect of upper 
thigh.
	
(2)	 Cleanse skin with alcohol.
	
(3)	 Insert 0.5-­inch, 25-­ or 27-­gauge needle into subcutaneous layer 
at a 45-­degree angle to the skin. Aspirate for blood, if none pres-
ent, inject medication/immunization.
	2.	 Intramuscular (IM) Injections
	
a.	 Indications: Immunizations and other medications.
	
b.	 Complications: Bleeding, infection, allergic reaction, nerve injury.
	
c.	 Cautions
	
(1)	 Avoid IM injections in a child with a bleeding disorder or 
thrombocytopenia.
	
(2)	 Maximum volume to be injected is 0.5 mL in a small infant, 1 
mL in an older infant, 2 mL in a school-­aged child, and 3 mL in 
an adolescent.
 

--- Page 120 ---
Chapter 4  Procedures    89
4
	
d.	 Procedure
	
(1)	 Locate injection site: Anterolateral upper thigh in smaller child 
or outer aspect of upper arm (deltoid) in older one. The dorsal 
gluteal region is less commonly used because of risk for nerve 
or vascular injury. To find the ventral gluteal site, form a triangle 
by placing your index finger on the anterior iliac spine and your 
middle finger on the most superior aspect of the iliac crest. The 
injection should occur in the middle of the triangle formed by the 
two fingers and the iliac crest.
	
(2)	 Cleanse skin with alcohol.
	
(3)	 Pinch muscle with free hand, and insert 1-­inch, 23-­ or 25-­gauge 
needle until hub is flush with skin surface. For deltoid and ven-
tral gluteal muscles, needle should be perpendicular to skin. For 
anterolateral thigh, needle should be at a 45-­degree angle to the 
long axis of the thigh. Aspirate for blood; if none present, inject 
medication. 
B.  Basic Laceration Repair2
	1.	 Wound Irrigation21,22: Numerous studies, including a large Cochrane 
review, conclude that there is no difference in the infection rates of 
wounds irrigated with either tap water or sterile NS. The volume of 
irrigation depends on the location and size of the wound; 100 mL/1 
cm of laceration is a good approximation for relatively uncontaminated 
wounds.
	2.	 Suturing:
	
a.	 Basic Suturing Technique (Fig. 4.9):
	
(1)	 Simple interrupted: Basic closure of most uncomplicated 
wounds.
	
(2)	 Horizontal mattress: Provides eversion of wound edges.
	
(3)	 Vertical mattress: For added strength in areas of thick skin or 
areas of skin movement; provides eversion of wound edges.
	
(4)	 Running intradermal: For cosmetic closures.
	
(5)	 Deep dermal: For bringing together deeper portions of wounds 
with dissolving sutures to allow improved approximation and 
closure of superficial surfaces.
	
b.	 Procedure:
	
(1)	 See Tables 4.1–4.3 for sutures material, size, and time for 
removal.23
	
(2)	 NOTE: Lacerations of the face, lips, hands, genitalia, mouth, 
or periorbital area may require consultation with a specialist. 
Ideally, lacerations at increased risk for infection (areas with 
poor blood supply, contaminated, or crush injury) should be 
sutured within 6 hours of injury. Clean wounds in cosmetically 
important areas may be closed up to 24 hours after injury in 
the absence of significant contamination or devitalization. In 
general, bite wounds should not be sutured except in areas 
 

--- Page 121 ---
90    Part I  Pediatric Acute Care
of high cosmetic importance (face) or if significant gaping is 
present. These wounds can be closed loosely to aid in healing 
by secondary intention. The longer sutures are left in place, 
the greater potential for scarring and infection. Sutures in

(4)	 Anesthetize the wound with topical anesthetic or with lidocaine 
mixed with bicarbonate (with or without epinephrine) by injecting 
the anesthetic into the subcutaneous tissues (see Chapter 6).
	
(5)	 Forcefully irrigate the wound as per above. This is the most 
important step in preventing infection.

(7)	 Débride the wound when indicated. Probe for foreign bodies 
as indicated. Consider obtaining a radiograph if a radiopaque 
foreign body is suspected.
	
(8)	 Select suture type for percutaneous closure (see Tables 
4.1–4.3).
	
(9)	 Match layers of injured tissues. Carefully match the depth of the 
bite taken on each side of the wound when suturing. Take equal 
bites from both wound edges. Apply slight thumb pressure on 
the wound edge as the needle is entering the opposite side. 
Pull the sutures to approximate wound edges but not too tightly, 
to avoid tissue necrosis. In delicate areas, sutures should be 
approximately 2 mm apart and 2 mm from the wound edge. 
Larger bites are acceptable where cosmesis is less important.2
	
(10)	 When suturing is complete, apply topical antibiotic and sterile 
dressing. If laceration is in proximity of a joint, splinting of the 
affected area to limit mobility often speeds healing and prevents 
wound dehiscence.
	
(11)	 Check wounds at 48 to 72 hours in cases where wounds are of 
questionable viability, if wound was packed, or for patients pre-
scribed prophylactic antibiotics. Change dressing at checkup.
	
(12)	 For hand lacerations, close skin only; do not use subcutaneous 
stitches. Elevate and immobilize the hand. Consider consulting 
a hand or plastics specialist.
	
(13)	 Consider the need for tetanus prophylaxis (see Chapter 16).
	
c.	 A video on basic laceration repair is available on the New England 
Journal of Medicine’s website
	3.	 Skin Staples
	
a.	 Indications:
	
(1)	 Best for scalp, trunk, extremity lacerations.
	
(2)	 More rapid application than sutures, but can be more painful to 
remove.
	
(3)	 Lower rates of wound infection.
	
b.	 Contraindications:
	
(1)	 Not for areas that require meticulous cosmesis.
	
(2)	 Avoid in patients who require magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
or CT.
	
c.	 Procedure:
	
(1)	 Apply topical anesthetic, as above. Injection of lidocaine is not 
routinely used when using staples.
	
(2)	 Clean and irrigate wound, as with suturing.

(3)	 Appose wound edges, press stapler firmly against skin at center 
of apposed edges, and staple.
	
(4)	 Apply antibiotic ointment and sterile bandage.
	
(5)	 Left in place for the same length of time as sutures (see Table 4.1).
	
(6)	 To remove, use dedicated staple remover.
	4.	 Tissue Adhesives24
	
a.	 Indications:
	
(1)	 For use with superficial lacerations with clean edges.
	
(2)	 Excellent cosmetic results, ease of application, and reduced 
patient anxiety.
	
(3)	 Lower rates of wound infection.
	
b.	 Contraindications:
	
(1)	 Not for use in areas under large amounts of tension (e.g., hands, 
joints).
	
(2)	 Use caution with areas near the eye or over areas with hair such 
as the eyebrow.
	
c.	 Procedure:
	
(1)	 Use pressure to achieve hemostasis and clean the wound as 
explained previously.
	
(2)	 Hold together wound edges.
	
(3)	 Apply adhesive dropwise along the wound surface, avoiding 
applying adhesive to the inside of the wound. Hold in place for 
20 to 30 seconds.
	
(4)	 If the wound is misaligned, remove the adhesive with forceps 
and reapply. Petroleum jelly or similar substance can aid in 
removal of skin adhesive.
	
(5)	 Adhesive will slough off after 7 to 10 days.
	
(6)	 Antibiotic ointments or other creams/lotions should not be 
applied to the adhesive, as this can cause premature loosening 
of the glue and subsequent wound dehiscence. 
C.  Incision and Drainage (I&D) of Abscess2
	1.	 Indications: Diagnostic and therapeutic drainage of soft tissue abscess.
	2.	 Complications: Inadequate abscess drainage, local tissue injury, pain, 
scar formation, and, in rare cases, fistula formation. Consider special-
ized surgical evaluation for abscesses in cosmetically or anatomically 
sensitive areas such as the face, breast, or the anogenital region.
	3.	 Ultrasound Identification: Ultrasound imaging can be used to differenti-
ate cellulitis from abscess.
	
a.	 Use a linear probe, place the probe over the area of interest, 
and scan it systematically such that the entire area of interest is 
examined.
	
b.	 Cellulitis characteristics on ultrasound:
	
(1)	 Increased edema; tissue may appear slightly darker, and will 
have distorted, indistinct margins.
	
(2)	 Areas may have a “cobblestone” appearance caused by edema 
(Fig. 4.10).
 

--- Page 125 ---
94    Part I  Pediatric Acute Care
	
c.	 Abscess characteristics on ultrasound:
	
(1)	 Dark fluid collection distinct from surrounding tissue (see Fig. 4.10).
	
(2)	 Often round or oval in shape.
	
(3)	 Doppler can help to distinguish between lymph nodes and fluid 
collections.

	4.	 Procedure:
	
a.	 Consider procedural sedation based upon the child’s expected 
tolerance of the procedure and the location/size/complexity of the 
abscess.
	
b.	 Apply topical anesthetic cream to the abscess to numb superficial 
epidermis (see Chapter 6).
	
c.	 Prepare the overlying skin in a sterile fashion, and once cleaned, 
numb the area using 1% lidocaine and a small gauge needle, per-
forming first a circumferential field block of the abscess area followed 
by direct injection to the planned incision site.
	
d.	 Incise the skin over the abscess down to the superficial fascia using 
a scalpel blade, cutting parallel to the natural crease of the skin, if 
present.
	
e.	 Using a hemostat, bluntly widen and undermine the incision to break 
up any septations or loculated fluid collections. Vigorously irrigate the 
wound using sterile saline to improve removal of purulent material.
	
f.	 If desired, introduce a sterile packing strip into the wound using a 
hemostat, making sure to fill in an outside-­to-­inside pattern without 
overfilling.
C 
FIGURE 4.10, cont’d
(C) A black (anechoic) rounded structure is noted in the soft tissue, which is charac-
teristic of a soft tissue abscess. Some abscesses may appear dark gray depending on 
the characteristics of the fluid within the abscess. (From Leeson K, Leeson B. Pediatric 
ultrasound: applications in the emergency department. Emerg Med Clin North Am. 
2013;31(3):809–829.)
 

--- Page 127 ---
96    Part I  Pediatric Acute Care
	
g.	 Leave a 2-­ to 3-­cm tail outside the wound to facilitate removal and 
cover the wound with an absorbent dressing. Packing material 
should be removed in 1 to 2 days with a minimum of daily dressing 
changes until healed.
	
h.	 Consider starting antibiotics that cover staphylococcus and strepto-
coccal species per local guidelines and resistance patterns.
	5.	 A video on I & D of Abscesses is available on the New England Journal of 
Medicine’s website. 
D.  Soft Tissue Aspiration25
	1.	 Indications: Cellulitis that is unresponsive to initial standard therapy, 
recurrent cellulitis or abscesses, immunocompromised patients in 
whom organism recovery is necessary and may affect antimicrobial 
therapy.
	2.	 Complications: Pain, infection, bleeding.
	3.	 Procedure:
	
a.	 Select site to aspirate at the point of maximal inflammation (more 
likely to increase recovery of causative agent than leading edge of 
erythema or center).
	
b.	 Cleanse area in a sterile fashion.
	
c.	 Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine is optional.
	
d.	 Fill tuberculin syringe with 0.1 to 0.2 mL of nonbacteriostatic sterile 
saline, and attach to needle.
	
e.	 Using 18-­ or 20-­gauge needle (22-­gauge for facial cellulitis), advance 
to appropriate depth, inject saline, aspirate fluid, and apply negative 
pressure while withdrawing needle.
	
f.	 Send fluid from aspiration for Gram stain and cultures. If no fluid is 
obtained, needle can be streaked on agar plate. Consider acid-­fast 
bacillus (AFB) and fungal stains in immunocompromised patients. 
E.  Tuberculin Skin Test Placement26
	1.	 Indications: Concern for exposure to tuberculosis.
	2.	 Contraindications: History of severe reactions to prior placements (e.g., 
necrosis, anaphylactic shock, ulcerations). Note that there is no contra-
indication for any other individuals including infants, children, pregnant 
women, or persons who have been vaccinated with bacille Calmette-­
Guérin (BCG). Note that although a tuberculin skin test (TST) may 
be placed on the same day as a receiving a live vaccine, a TST must 
otherwise be placed 4 to 6 weeks after administration of a live vaccine 
(if not placed that same day).
	3.	 Complications: Soreness, necrosis.
	4.	 Procedure: Inject 0.1 mL of tuberculin purified protein derivative 
(PPD) with a tuberculin syringe (bevel up) into the forearm at a 5-­ to 
15-­degree angle. The bevel should be visible just below the skin sur-
face. The injection should produce a pale elevation of the skin 6 to 10 
mm in diameter.
 

--- Page 128 ---
Chapter 4  Procedures    97
4
	5.	 Follow-­Up: A TST should be read between 48 and 72 hours after admin-
istration. The reaction is measured across the forearm (perpendicular 
to the long axis) in millimeters of induration (palpable, raised, hardened 
area or swelling). Do not measure erythema.
	6.	 Interpretation: see Chapter 17. 
F.  Tick Removal27
	1.	 Indications: Visualization of tick. Urgent removal is essential, as the risk 
of Lyme disease transmission significantly increases after 24 hours of 
attachment with the risk highest at 48 to 72 hours.
	2.	 Complications: Retention of tick fragments (particularly mouthparts), 
infection, granuloma formation.
	3.	 Procedure: Only the use of blunt, medium-­tipped, angled forceps or 
protected fingers have been shown to result in effective removal of ticks.
	
a.	 Use blunt forceps to grasp the tick at the skin surface. Lift up firmly, 
applying steady pressure and without a twisting motion. Take care 
to not squeeze the body of the tick, because its fluid may leak infec-
tious material.
	
b.	 Apply antiseptic solution to the attachment site and provide patients 
with signs and symptoms of both local and systemic illness.

A.  Ultrasound-­Guided Lumbar Puncture
	1.	 Use the linear probe. Before preparing the patient, obtain a transverse 
view of the spine perpendicular to its axis. In the transverse view, 
identify the anatomic midline by locating the spinous process. The peri-
osteum of the spinous process will appear as a hyperechoic, rounded 
structure with dark, posterior shadowing. Center the spinous process in 
the middle of the probe and mark a line in a cephalad-­caudad direction 
on the patient’s back to identify the midline (Fig. EC 4.A).
	2.	 Rotate the probe 90 degrees to obtain a longitudinal view (probe parallel 
to the spine). Identify the vertebral bodies and an intervertebral space 
above or below L4. Mark a line on either side of the skin correlating with 
the space (Fig. EC 4.B).
	3.	 The intersection of the marks identifies the area to be punctured. The 
crosshairs formed by the marks should leave the actual insertion site 
clean (Fig. EC 4.C).
	4.	 The procedure should progress with no further movement of the patient. 
Preparation and draping should proceed from this point toward comple-
tion of the procedure.

B.  External Jugular Puncture and Catheterization2
	1.	 Indications: Blood sampling in patients with inadequate peripheral 
vascular access or during resuscitation.
	2.	 Complications: Infection, bleeding, pneumothorax.
	3.	 Procedure: (Fig. EC 4.D)
	
a.	 Restrain patient securely with head turned 45 degrees to the contra-
lateral side of cannulation. Position with towel roll under shoulders 
or with head over side of bed to extend neck and accentuate the 
posterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the side of 
venipuncture. Place patient in the 15-­ to 20-­degree Trendelenburg 
position.
	
b.	 Prepare area in a sterile fashion.
	
c.	 The external jugular vein will distend if its most proximal segment 
is occluded or if the child cries. The vein runs from the angle of the 
mandible to the posterior border of the lower third of the sternoclei-
domastoid muscle.

I.  ADOLESCENT HEALTH MAINTENANCE
A.  Confidentiality
Begin integrating one-­on-­one time with the provider and patient into ado-
lescent visits as early as age 11 to provide teens with regular opportunities 
to discuss concerns and sensitive topics in an open manner.1 Adolescents 
are concerned about the confidentiality of their interactions with healthcare 
providers.2,3 Providers should be aware of barriers to confidentiality related to 
consent laws and billing/explanation of benefits by insurance companies.4
	1.	 Consent laws: All states and the District of Columbia allow minors to 
consent to sexually transmitted infection (STI) services (diagnosis and 
treatment), although some states have a minimum age to consent. 
Laws surrounding consent to HIV testing and treatment, contraception, 
abortion, and other healthcare services vary by state. Current informa-
tion on consent laws by state can be found at the Guttmacher Institute’s 
website (https://www.guttmacher.org/state-­policy/explore/overview-
minors-­consent-­law).5
	2.	 Breach of confidentiality: Confidentiality must be breached if the 
adolescent is at risk of harming themselves or others (e.g., suicidal or 
homicidal ideation). Cases of child abuse or neglect must be reported to 
child protective services. The definition of statutory rape and report-
ing laws vary by state, with minimum age to consent to sexual activity 
ranging from 16 to 18 years old. Current information on reporting laws 
by state can be found at the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network’s 
website (https://rainn.org/public-­policy-­action).6 
B.  History Elements Unique to the Adolescent Patient
	1.	 Psychosocial development7: Progression through adolescence is charac-
terized by cognitive, psychosocial, and emotional developments, which 
help adolescents to establish their identity and autonomy. See Table EC 
5.A for detailed psychosocial development by age.
	2.	 HEADSS assessment8–10: A screening tool for psychosocial factors, which 
impact adolescent mental, physical, and sexual health (Box 5.1).
	3.	 Screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) for  
substance use11:
	
a.	 Screening: If adolescent has used any alcohol, marijuana, or other drugs 
in the past 12 months, administer CRAFFT questionnaire (Box 5.2). If 
not, administer only the “Car” question (Have you ever ridden in a car 
with a driver who had used alcohol or drugs?).
 

--- Page 136 ---
102    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
BOX 5.1
HE2ADS3 (MODIFIED HEADSS) ASSESSMENT8
(H)OME: Household composition, family dynamics and relationships, living and 
sleeping arrangements, recent changes, any periods of homelessness, running 
away from home
(E)DUCATION/EMPLOYMENT, (E)ATING: School performance, attendance, sus-
pensions; attitude toward school; favorite, most difficult, best subjects; special 
educational needs; goals for the future; after-­school job or other work history; 
body image and dieting
(A)CTIVITIES: Friendships with same or opposite sex, ages of friends, best friend, 
dating, recreational activities, physical activity, sports participation, hobbies, 
and interests
(D)RUGS: Personal use of tobacco, alcohol, illicit drugs, anabolic steroids; peer 
substance use; family substance use and attitudes; if personal use, determine 
frequency, quantity, binge, injury with use; consider use of CRAFFT question-
naire (Box 5.2)
(S)EXUALITY: Sexual orientation, gender identity, and relationship(s) should 
be explored with open-­ended questions. If the adolescent is sexually active, 
discuss age of first sexual act, number of lifetime and current partners, ages 
of partners, knowledge of contraception and sexually transmitted infection/
human immunodeficiency virus (STI/HIV) prevention, reproductive life plan, 
prior testing for STI/HIV, prior pregnancies and/or abortions, and history of 
nonconsensual intimate physical contact or sex. See Box EC 5.A for the “Five 
Ps” of the sexual history
(S)UICIDE/DEPRESSION: Feelings about self, both positive and negative; history 
of depression or other mental health problems; sleep problems (difficulty get-
ting to sleep, early waking); changes in appetite or weight; anhedonia; irritabil-
ity; anxiety; current or prior suicidal thoughts or attempts; other self-­harming or 
injurious behavior; screen for depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire 
(PHQ-­2)
(S)AFETY: Feeling unsafe at home, at school, or in the community; bullying; guns 
in the home; weapon carrying, what kinds of weapons; fighting; arrests; gang 
membership; seatbelt use
BOX 5.2
CRAFFT QUESTIONNAIRE10
C—Have you ever ridden in a CAR driven by someone (or yourself) who was 
“high” or had been using alcohol or drugs?
R—Do you ever use alcohol or drugs to RELAX, feel better about yourself, or fit in?
A—Do you ever use alcohol/drugs while you are ALONE?
F—Do your family or FRIENDS ever tell you that you should cut down on your 
drinking or drug use?
F—Do you ever FORGET things you did while using alcohol or drugs?
T—Have you gotten into TROUBLE while you were using alcohol or drugs?
NOTE: Answering yes to two or more questions is a positive screen

b.	 Brief Intervention: Stratify risk based on responses to screening 
questions.
	
(1)	 Low risk (abstinent): Reinforce decisions with praise and provide 
anticipatory guidance regarding riding in a car with a driver 
under the influence.
	
(2)	 Yes to “Car” question: Counsel and encourage safety plan.
	
(3)	 Moderate risk (CRAFFT negative): Advise cessation of substance 
use, educate regarding health risks of continued use, and praise 
personal attributes.
	
(4)	 High risk (CRAFFT ≥2): Conduct in-­depth assessment using 
motivational enhancement techniques, conduct brief negotiated 
interview, or refer as appropriate.
	
c.	 Referral to Treatment: Further evaluation by a specialist in mental 
health/addiction can guide referral to an appropriate level of care.
	4.	 Social media12: Explore how social media is used and for what quantity 
of time.
	
a.	 Benefits: Communication and engagement.
	
b.	 Risks of excessive/inappropriate use: Impaired sleep, attention, 
and learning; obesity; depression; viewing of unsuitable content; 
decrease in caregiver-­child interactions; compromised privacy; 
meeting high-risk sexual partners or sexual predators, sexting, and 
cyberbullying.

fibrocystic changes and fibroadenomas in females, or gynecomastia in 
males), breast asymmetry (common occurrence in adolescence; more 
pronounced between Tanner pubertal stages 2 and 4).
	
a.	 Normal female breast development: See Fig. 5.1.
	
b.	 Physiologic gynecomastia in males:
	
(1)	 Epidemiology: Generally, occurs in middle to late stages of 
puberty (usually peaks in Tanner pubertal stage 3); occurs in 
50% of boys (50% unilateral, 50% bilateral).
	
(2)	 Etiology: Breast growth stimulated by estradiol.
	
(3)	 Clinical course: Regression usually occurs over a 2-­year period.

(4)	 Physical examination: Firm glandular tissue in a concentric mass 
beneath the areola/nipple is consistent with physiologic gyneco-
mastia. A testicular examination should also be performed.
	
(5)	 Differential diagnosis: Nonphysiologic gynecomastia. Common 
causes include medication or substance use, primary or second-
ary hypogonadism, cirrhosis, hyperthyroidism, tumors, and 
pseudogynecomastia (excess adipose tissue on exam).
	
(6)	 Red flags: Symptom duration over 2 years, nipple discharge, 
skin changes, breast masses, and coincident testicular 
abnormalities.
	
(7)	 Treatment: Often no treatment is necessary. Severe or non-
regressing cases may warrant referral to pediatric surgeon, endo-
crinologist, or oncologist, depending on suspected etiology.

	5.	 Genitalia: For both male and female genital examinations, a chaperone 
should be present, an explanation should occur before the examination, 
and findings should be discussed.
	
a.	 Male15:
	
(1)	 Normal male genital development: Table 5.1.
	
(2)	 Normal pubic hair development: Table 5.2.
	
(3)	 Assess for signs of STIs (rashes, warts, ulcers, erosions,  
discharge), inguinal hernias, masses, hydroceles, and varico-
celes. If there are symptoms of proctitis with history of receptive 
anal intercourse (e.g., rectal pain, rectal bleeding, or tenesmus), 
a digital rectal examination should be performed.

(3)	 Pelvic examination: Speculum exams are not routinely recom-
mended for healthy asymptomatic women under 21 years of 
age. Indications for bimanual exam or speculum exam include: 
vaginal discharge with lower abdominal or pelvic pain (assess 
cervix for mucopurulent discharge, friability, large ectropion, 
foreign body, or cervical motion tenderness), menstrual disorders 
(amenorrhea, abnormal vaginal bleeding, or dysmenorrhea 
refractory to medical therapy), and Pap smear (see Section 
I.D.6).
	
(4)	 For suspected or reported sexual abuse or rape, refer to a 
specialized center if not appropriately trained and equipped 
to document evidence of trauma and collect forensic 
specimens.
Note: See Chapter 10 for information about precocious and delayed 
puberty. 
D.  Screening Laboratory Tests and Procedures
A lack of evidence has led to variability in guidelines for topics such as 
screening for dyslipidemia, iron-­deficiency anemia, diabetes, and tubercu-
losis. The recommendations that follow are largely based on the AAP, CDC, 
U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), and the American College 
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG).1,18–20
	1.	 Immunizations: See Chapter 16.
	2.	 Cholesterol screening: All children should undergo cholesterol screening 
once between ages 9 and 11 years and once between ages 17 and 21 
years.
	3.	 Diabetes screening: Consider screening for type 2 diabetes with hemo-
globin A1c, fasting plasma glucose, or oral glucose tolerance test in 
children who have a BMI greater than 85% for age and sex with other 
risk factors such as family history.21
	4.	 Consider selective screening for tuberculosis, anemia, and vision and 
hearing abnormalities if patient screens positive on risk screening 
questions.
	5.	 STI screening: See Section II.
	6.	 Papanicolaou (Pap) smear cervical cancer screening: Cytologic evalu-
ation should be used. Human papilloma virus (HPV) testing is only 
recommended for routine screening above age 30. Recommended 
screening intervals and follow-­up depend on age, medical history, and 
result of previous Pap smear, as presented in Table 5.3. 
II.  SEXUAL HEALTH
A.  Sexually Transmitted Infection Screening Guidelines by Sexual 
Behavior18,22,23
	1.	 All adolescents over age 13: The CDC recommends universal screening 
for HIV (via HIV 1/2 antigen/antibody test) at least once using an opt-­out 
approach, or more frequently based on risk factors.

	2.	 Heterosexual with one lifetime partner:
	
a.	 Male: Screen once with HIV 1/2 antigen/antibody test; gonorrhea and 
chlamydia urine nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) in high preva-
lence clinical settings (e.g., adolescent clinics, correctional facilities, 
STI clinics). Repeat as indicated by sexual risk.
	
b.	 Female: Screen once with HIV 1/2 antigen/antibody test; self-­ or 
provider-­collected vaginal NAAT for gonorrhea and chlamydia (rou-
tine screening recommended in sexually active women under age 
25). Repeat as indicated by sexual risk. Vaginal swab is the preferred 
method to screen for gonorrhea and chlamydia; self-­collected speci-
mens may have higher patient acceptability. Vaginal swabs are as 
sensitive and specific as cervical swabs, and both are more accurate 
than urine samples.24
	3.	 Heterosexual with risk factors (new partner, multiple partners, partner 
with STI, intravenous drug use):
	
a.	 Male: Annual HIV 1/2 antigen/antibody test, rapid plasma reagin 
(RPR), and gonorrhea and chlamydia urine NAAT.
	
b.	 Female: Annual HIV 1/2 antigen/antibody test, RPR, and self-­ or 
provider-­collected vaginal NAAT for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and 
trichomonas.
	
c.	 In adolescents with a history of an STI, repeat testing is recom-
mended 3 months after treatment given high risk of reinfection.
	4.	 Men who have sex with men (MSM): Annual HIV 1/2 antigen/antibody test, 
RPR, and gonorrhea and chlamydia NAAT (test sites of sexual contact: 
pharynx, urethra, and/or rectum) are recommended. For MSM with mul-
tiple or anonymous partners, consider 3 to 6 month interval STI testing.
	5.	 Women who have sex with women (WSW): Equivalent STI screening as 
heterosexual women, guided by sexual practices (e.g., gonorrhea and chla-
mydia NAAT should be done at sites of sexual contact) and risk factors.
	6.	 Pregnant women: At the first visit, pregnant patients should be screened 
with HIV 1/2 antigen/antibody test, RPR, vaginal gonorrhea and chla-
mydia NAAT, and hepatitis B surface antigen test.
	7.	 Transgender: Given the diversity of transgender persons regarding pat-
terns of sexual behavior, hormone use, and surgery, clinicians should 
assess STI risk based on the patient’s sexual behaviors and current 
anatomy (the latter of which should guide method of NAAT testing, if 
indicated).
	8.	 Concern for recent exposure to STI:
	
a.	 Fourth generation HIV 1/2 antigen/antibody tests detect acute infec-
tion within 10 to 14 days. If there is concern for acute or early HIV 
exposure, consider an HIV RNA nucleic acid test.25
	
b.	 Screen with RPR, gonorrhea and chlamydia NAAT (method of testing 
as described above by sexual behavior), and vaginal trichomonas 
NAAT for women.
	
c.	 Consider HSV PCR testing in individuals presenting for STI evaluation 
with genital lesion(s).

Chapter 5  Adolescent Medicine    109
5
	9.	 Persons living with HIV: Screen at least annually with RPR, gonorrhea 
and chlamydia NAAT (method of testing as described above by sexual 
behavior), and vaginal trichomonas NAAT for women. Screen more 
frequently if indicated by sexual risk behaviors. 
B.  Sexually Transmitted Infection Evaluation and Management  
(Table 5.4)
	1.	 HIV: See Chapter 17 for information on diagnosis and treatment of HIV, 
pre-­exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). 
PrEP should be initiated in the primary care setting, when possible.
	2.	 Syphilis18
	
a.	 Etiology: Treponema pallidum
	
b.	 Early syphilis (within 1 year of initial infection)
	
(1)	 Primary syphilis (chancre): Firm, usually painless sore(s) or 
ulcer(s) develop at the site of initial infection (genital, rectal, 
or oral). Chancres typically develop within 3 weeks of infec-
tion and heal 3 to 6 weeks after development in the absence of 
treatment.
	
(2)	 Secondary syphilis: Within weeks to months after a chancre 
appears, patients may develop body rash involving palms and 
soles, mucocutaneous lesions, lymphadenopathy, constitutional 
symptoms, and/or early neurosyphilis (e.g., meningitis or ocular 
syphilis).
	
(3)	 Early latent syphilis: Asymptomatic stage.
	
c.	 Late syphilis (over 1 year after initial infection)
	
(1)	 Late latent syphilis: Asymptomatic stage.
	
(2)	 Tertiary syphilis: Organ involvement may progress to cardio-
vascular syphilis (e.g., aortitis), late neurosyphilis (e.g., tabes 
dorsalis or paresis), or gummatous syphilis.
	
d.	 Diagnosis: Testing algorithm varies by laboratory and typically 
includes a nontreponemal test (RPR or Venereal Disease Research 
Laboratory [VDRL] test) and a treponemal test (e.g., fluorescent 
treponemal antibody absorbed [FTA-­ABS] test, enzyme immunoas-
say) for confirmation.
	
e.	 Treatment: See Table 5.4. Clinical and serologic evaluation should 
be performed 6 and 12 months after treatment to ensure a fourfold 
reduction in nontreponemal titers or seroreversion. Monitor for 
Jarisch-­Herxheimer reaction (fever, headache, and myalgias) within 
24 hours of treatment.
	
f.	 Partner treatment: Partners with sexual contact within 90 days of 
a patient’s diagnosis should be treated empirically. Partners with 
sexual contact over 90 days prior to diagnosis should be evalu-
ated for treatment based on CDC 2015 STD Treatment Guidelines: 
http://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/.
	
g.	 See Chapter 17 for information on neonatal syphilis and interpreta-
tion of maternal and neonatal syphilis testing.

112    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	3.	 Chlamydia and gonorrhea18
	
a.	 Etiology: Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae
	
b.	 Clinical manifestations: Urethritis, cervicitis, pharyngitis, proctitis, 
epididymitis, prostatitis. Other manifestations include:
	
(1)	 Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV): Lymphoproliferative 
reaction caused by C. trachomatis serovars L1 to L3 that most 
frequently presents as proctitis and lymphadenopathy in patients 
who are MSM or HIV positive.
	
(2)	 Disseminated gonococcal infection: Bacteremic spread of N. 
gonorrhoeae results in septic arthritis or arthritis-­dermatitis 
syndrome (polyarthralgia, tenosynovitis, and dermatitis). In addi-
tion to urogenital, rectal, and pharyngeal NAAT, workup should 
include blood, synovial, or CSF cultures, as applicable.
	
c.	 Diagnosis: Site-­specific NAAT, including urogenital (urine NAAT 
in males, urine or vaginal NAAT in females [see Section II.A.2.b]), 
pharyngeal, and rectal.
	
d.	 Treatment: See Table 5.4.
	
e.	 Partner treatment: Partners should be treated. For partners for whom 
providers are concerned about access to prompt clinical evaluation 
and treatment, expedited partner therapy may be an option depend-
ing on local and state laws.
	4.	 Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID): Acute infection of the female upper 
genital tract.18
	
a.	 Etiology: Often polymicrobial in nature, however N. gonorrhoeae and 
C. trachomatis are the most commonly identified pathogens, followed 
by Mycoplasma genitalium.
	
b.	 Differential diagnosis: Endometriosis, tubo-­ovarian abscess (TOA), 
ovarian cyst, ectopic pregnancy, acute surgical abdomen, inflam-
matory bowel disease (IBD), pyelonephritis, dysmenorrhea, septic/
threatened abortion
	
c.	 Workup: Pelvic and bimanual examination, gonorrhea/chlamydia and 
HIV testing, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), wet preparation, 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-­reactive protein (CRP), and 
urinalysis/urine culture if clinically indicated. Consider a complete 
blood cell count (CBC) with differential and pelvic ultrasound if the 
patient is ill-­appearing, has an adnexal mass on bimanual examina-
tion, or is not improving after antibiotics.
	
d.	 Minimum diagnostic criteria: Uterine, adnexal, or cervical motion 
tenderness without other identifiable causes. One or more of the 
following additional criteria enhances specificity: fever (>38.3°C), 
mucopurulent vaginal or cervical discharge, leukocytes on saline 
microscopy, increased ESR or CRP, laboratory documentation of 
chlamydial or gonorrhea infection.
	
e.	 Treatment: See Table 5.4.
	
f.	 Admission criteria: Cannot exclude acute surgical abdomen, pres-
ence of TOA, pregnancy, immunodeficiency, severe illness, inability

to tolerate or follow outpatient oral regimen, failure to respond to 
appropriate outpatient therapy, or follow-­up cannot be ensured.
	5.	 Trichomoniasis18
	
a.	 Etiology: Trichomonas vaginalis
	
b.	 Diagnosis and treatment: See Table 5.5.
	
c.	 Follow-­up: Women treated for trichomoniasis should be retested 3 
months after treatment due to high rates of reinfection.
	
d.	 Partner treatment: Partners should be treated to prevent reinfection.
	6.	 Mycoplasma genitalium18
	
a.	 Etiology: Mycoplasma genitalium
	
b.	 Clinical manifestations: Persistent urethritis, cervicitis, or PID despite 
appropriate treatment.
	
c.	 Diagnosis: No FDA-­approved diagnostic test; NAAT is available in 
some large medical centers and commercial laboratories.
	
d.	 Treatment: Moxifloxacin has been used successfully; refer to latest 
CDC treatment guidelines.
	7.	 Vaginal infections, genital ulcers, and warts
	
a.	 Diagnostic features of vaginal infections (see Table 5.5) can assist 
in differentiating normal vaginal discharge from bacterial vaginosis, 
trichomoniasis, and yeast vaginitis.
	
b.	 Diagnostic features of genital lesions, as well as management of 
warts and ulcers, are presented in Table 5.6. 
C.  Gender and Sexual Behavior
	1.	 Terminology and definitions:
	
a.	 Sexual orientation26,27: Sexual orientation relates to sexual attraction, 
identity, and behavior. It is not related to gender identity. It should be 
defined by the individual patient.
	
b.	 Gender identity: An individual’s self-­awareness as male or female.
	
c.	 Gender expression: The way an individual expresses their gender 
(e.g., clothing and speech); may differ from gender identity.
	
d.	 Sex assigned at birth: Often based on phenotype (external genitals, 
gonads, and internal sex organs) and karyotype (XX, XY, XO, XXY, 
etc.); assigned at birth.
	
e.	 Transgender: An individual whose gender identity differs from the sex 
assigned at birth.
	
f.	 Cisgender: An individual whose gender identity is the same as the 
sex assigned at birth.
	
g.	 Gender nonbinary: Gender expression by an individual that does not 
match masculine and feminine gender norms.
	
h.	 Gender dysphoria28: Discomfort or distress caused by discrepancy 
between a person’s gender identity and sex assigned at birth. DSM-­V 
criteria recommends a diagnosis occur after 6 months of continuous 
incongruence. For prepubescent children, the desire to be of the 
other gender must be present and verbalized.
	2.	 Special considerations in adolescents:
	
a.	 Adolescents may engage in a variety of sexual activities (penile-­vaginal, 
anal, or oral intercourse) that do not reflect their sexual orientation (e.g.,

heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual). Conversely, adolescents may self-­
identify with a particular sexual orientation but not be sexually active.
	
b.	 Sexual identity emerges during adolescence. It is important to pro-
vide a safe environment for adolescents to discuss questions about 
their sexual identity and behavior, and ask questions about sexual 
activities regardless of sexual orientation.
	3.	 Medical interventions for gender-­dysphoric or transgender patients29–31:
	
a.	 Prepubertal children: Parental support and education to create a 
safe environment for the child. Familial support of social transition for 
transgender children has been associated with better mental health 
outcomes.
	
b.	 Pubertal suppression (reversible): GnRH analogue (e.g., Lupron and 
Supprelin) can be used to suppress endogenous hormones after 
onset of puberty.
	
c.	 Gender-­affirming hormone therapy (partially irreversible): Estradiol or 
testosterone therapy with gradual dose escalation initiated after a multi-
disciplinary team of medical and mental health providers has confirmed 
the persistence of gender dysphoria/gender incongruence and sufficient 
mental capacity to give informed consent (generally by the age of 16 
years). Treatment can be considered as early as age 13.5 to 14 years.
	
d.	 Gender-­affirming surgery (including gonadectomy, hysterectomy, mas-
tectomy, and genital surgery): Not recommended until age of majority. 
D.  Contraception32,33
	1.	 Special considerations in adolescents:
	
a.	 Over 40% of adolescents in the United States have had sexual inter-
course and over 75% of adolescent pregnancies are unplanned.34,35
	
b.	 Barriers may include confidentiality concerns (e.g., fear of parental dis-
closure), fear of pelvic examination, and fear of medication side effects.
	
c.	 Long-­acting reversible contraception (LARC) methods have well-­
established safety and efficacy and are first-­line contraceptive 
methods according to the ACOG and the AAP. Adherence and 
continuation rates of LARC methods in adolescents are superior to 
short-­acting contraceptives. To avoid a delay in initiation, quick start 
method should be considered for most adolescents.36
	
d.	 Providers should pay special attention to informed consent, confi-
dentiality, parental involvement, insurance coverage, and cost. If an 
adolescent does not have or does not want to use their insurance 
coverage, refer to a clinic with Title X or other public funding (http://
www.hhs.gov/opa/).
	
e.	 Counseling should include discussion of need for barrier method to 
prevent STIs.
	2.	 Method comparison (Fig. 5.2)37:

hormonal contraceptive method and the CDC’s Selected Practice 
Recommendations (http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/unintend
edPregnancy/USSPR.htm) for minimum requirements to start each 
method.
	
(1)	 To start a hormonal method, the basic medical history should 
include assessment of clotting risk, blood pressure, pregnancy 
status, and any other pertinent medical comorbidities.
	
(2)	 Combined hormonal contraception is associated with a small 
increase in risk for thrombosis including deep vein thrombosis, 
myocardial infarction, and stroke.38 The risk is higher in women 
who smoke more than 15 cigarettes a day, women over 35 
years old, and women with other risk factors for cardiovascular 
disease.
	
(3)	 To support adherence and continuation, use a patient-­centered 
approach, review method effectiveness, and provide anticipatory 
guidance regarding side effects of each method when assisting 
an adolescent in selecting a new contraceptive method.
	
b.	 Quick start (Fig. 5.3): Starting a method of contraception on the day 
of the visit (not waiting until a new menstrual cycle begins) should 
be considered for most adolescents. Can be used for all methods, 
including LARC, if there is reasonable certainty that the patient is 
not pregnant (Box 5.3). A urine pregnancy test should be performed 
when using this approach.39
	4.	 Specific contraceptive methods:
Note: Contraceptive methods are described in order of effectiveness.
	
a.	 Intrauterine device (IUD)36: LARC inserted into the uterus. Safe to use 
among adolescents, may be inserted without difficulty in most ado-
lescents and nulliparous women; expulsion is uncommon. Among 
the most effective forms of birth control. Does not increase risk of 
infertility; baseline fertility returns rapidly after removal. Increased 
risk of pelvic infection with placement, but the absolute risk of infec-
tion is low and exists only within the first 3 weeks after placement. 
Screening is recommended for gonorrhea and chlamydia at the time 
of insertion based on the CDC guidelines as age (<25 years old) is a 
risk factor for STIs. Insertion should not be delayed for test results; 
treatment can occur without IUD removal.
	
(1)	 Copper (Paragard): Hormone-­free, FDA approved for 10 years of 
use although data supports potential efficacy for an additional 1 
to 2 years.36,40

(2)	 Progestin-­containing (Levonorgestrel): There are four types with 
differing amounts of progestin. Mirena is FDA approved for 5 
years; data supports an additional 2 years.36,41 Kyleena is FDA 
approved for 5 years. Liletta is FDA approved for 4 years; data 
supports an additional year.36,42 Skyla is FDA approved for 3 
years.
	
(3)	 Changes in bleeding patterns are common in first months of use. 
Copper IUD may cause heavier menses. Many women using 
the levonorgestrel IUD will have a decrease in bleeding over 
time. First-­line treatment for bleeding and spotting is NSAIDs.43 
Bleeding concerns that are not associated with device insertion 
should be evaluated for other etiologies.
	
b.	 Subdermal implant: Progestin-­only LARC, 4-­cm rod inserted into 
the upper arm. Newer model (Nexplanon) is radio-­opaque. FDA 
approved for 3 years; studies show efficacy for up to 5 years.41 
Minimal or no effect on bone density or body weight; causes a 
change in bleeding patterns. Return to fertility is rapid after removal. 
May be less effective for women who are overweight or obese. 
Among the most effective forms of birth control.
	
(1)	 Removal requires a small incision and takes an average of 1 
minute.
	
(2)	 Persistent irregular bleeding is the most common complaint 
resulting in implant removal, but continuation rates among 
adolescents remain high.44 As opposed to levonorgestrel IUD, 
bleeding changes persist throughout duration of use. The 
bleeding pattern in the first 3 months of use is predictive of 
future bleeding. Important to provide preinsertion anticipatory 
guidance. Consider postinsertion management of bleeding with 
NSAIDs, combined OCPs, or doxycycline.37,45
	
c.	 Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA [Depo-­Provera]) injection: 
Progestin-­only injection into arm every 13 to 15 weeks. Typical failure 
BOX 5.3
HOW TO BE REASONABLY CERTAIN THAT A WOMAN IS NOT PREGNANT
If the patient has no symptoms or signs of pregnancy and meets any of the follow-
ing criteria:
	
1.	 Is ≤7 days after the start of normal menses
	
2.	 Has not had sexual intercourse since the start of last normal menses
	
3.	 Has been correctly and consistently using a reliable method of 
contraception
	
4.	 Is ≤7 days after spontaneous or induced abortion
	
5.	 Is within 4 weeks postpartum
	
6.	 Is fully or nearly fully breastfeeding, amenorrheic, and <6 months 
postpartum

rate: 6%. Delayed return to fertility (9 to 18 months). Menstrual 
irregularity is common, but often resolves after several cycles. May 
cause weight gain, but not a uniform finding in studies.
	
(1)	 Patient should be encouraged to receive adequate calcium and 
vitamin D due to association with decrease in bone mineral 
density.
	
(2)	 FDA black box warning: Should not be used for longer than 
2 consecutive years unless other forms of birth control are 
inadequate due to bone mineral density concerns. Bone density 
returns after discontinuation. The risk of loss of bone mineral 
density should be weighed against the need for effective contra-
ception in the context of each adolescent.39
	
d.	 Combined hormonal oral contraceptive pills (OCPs): Combination 
of estrogen and progestin taken daily. “Low-­dose” (35 mCg or less 
of ethinyl estradiol) pills are the recommended dosing for adoles-
cents. Back-­up method needed for at least 7 days after initiation. 
Typical failure rates are approximately 9% and may be higher in 
teens. Known to improve dysmenorrhea and are first-­line therapy for 
endometriosis. Newer formulations exist, known as extended-­cycle 
regimens, which reduce the number of menstrual cycles per year.
	
(1)	 The first pill should be taken either on the day of the visit (quick 
start) or between the first and seventh day after the start of the 
menstrual period (most commonly Sunday).
	
(2)	 Some pill packs have 28 pills, others have 21 pills. When the 
28-­day pack is empty, immediately start taking pills from a new 
pack. When the 21-­day pack is empty, wait 1 week (7 days), 
then begin taking pills from a new pack.
	
(3)	 If a pill is missed, it should be taken as soon as remembered, 
even if it means taking two pills in 1 day. If two or more pills 
missed, two pills should be taken daily until back on schedule 
and a backup method should be used for 7 days.
	
e.	 Progestin-­only pills: Can be used for those with contraindications to 
estrogen-­containing formulations. Require daily use and are more 
sensitive to timing (should be taken at same time each day); have no 
pill-­free interval. Considered less effective than combined hormonal 
methods. Irregular bleeding is a common adverse effect.
	
f.	 Transdermal (patch) contraceptive: Contains estrogen and progestin, 
measures 1.75 × 1.75 in. Place on abdomen, upper torso, upper 
outer arm, or buttocks. Use one patch for 3 weeks, then remove for 
1 week for withdrawal bleed. Greater exposure to estrogen than with 
other methods; may have more estrogen-­related side effects. There 
may be a greater risk for thromboembolism compared to OCPs, 
though the data is not clear.46 May be less effective in women who 
weigh more than 90 kg.
	
g.	 Vaginal ring: Flexible latex-­free ring that contains estrogen and 
progestin. Placed in vagina for 3 weeks, removed for 1 week for 
 

--- Page 158 ---
Chapter 5  Adolescent Medicine    123

withdrawal bleeding. May be used continuously (avoiding week of 
menses) by replacing with a new ring every 4 weeks (or the same 
day every month) to help reduce pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea. May 
be removed for up to 3 hours (not recommended in adolescents). 
Requires user comfort with insertion and removal. Screen for comfort 
with this method by asking if the adolescent is comfortable using 
tampons. Typical use failure rate similar to other combined hormonal 
methods (9%).
	
h.	 Barrier methods: Require placement prior to sexual intercourse. 
Include cervical sponge, cervical cap, cervical shield, diaphragm 
(these methods are used in conjunction with spermicide), as well as 
female and male condoms. Male condom is most commonly used 
birth control among adolescents with a failure rate of 18% with typi-
cal use.37 Use latex condoms only with water-­based lubricants; oil-­
based lubricants are not recommended. While barrier methods are 
less effective than other methods of contraception, their use should 
still be emphasized for prevention of STIs.
	
i.	 Fertility awareness-­based methods of pregnancy prevention: Involves 
following a woman’s menstrual cycle to help prevent pregnancy.
5.	 Emergency contraception (EC)47: Used to prevent pregnancy following 
unprotected sex (including sexual assault) or a recent possible failure of 
another method of contraception.
	
a.	 Mechanism: Hormonal methods work by delaying ovulation. Copper 
IUD inhibits fertilization by affecting sperm viability and function. All 
methods are only effective before implantation takes place and will 
not disrupt an implanted pregnancy.
	
b.	 Efficacy48: Copper IUD is the most effective method, but requires 
a clinic visit for insertion. Ulipristal is the next most effective, but 
requires a prescription. Levonorgestrel is the next most effective and 
is available over the counter. The Yuzpe regimen is the least effective 
and has the most side effects.
	
c.	 Timing: Hormonal methods are most effective when given as soon as 
possible. Efficacy declines linearly with time but there is efficacy up 
to 120 hours after intercourse. Ulipristal and copper IUD maintain 
high efficacy when taken up to 120 hours after intercourse.
	
d.	 Pregnancy should be excluded based on history, physical exam, or 
pregnancy testing before prescribing ulipristal or placing an IUD, as 
they may adversely affect an established pregnancy.
	
e.	 Methods:
	
(1)	 Progestin only: Levonorgestrel. Take 1.5 mg orally once (may be 
packaged as 1.5 mg tablet or two 0.75 mg tablets).
	
(2)	 Antiprogestins: Ulipristal (“Ella”). Take 30 mg orally once. 
Mifepristone is an alternative agent used in some countries as 
EC, but is not available in the U.S. for this purpose.
	
(3)	 Ethinyl estradiol plus levonorgestrel (Yuzpe regimen): Patients 
take multiple OCPs from packets designed for 28-­day use. Take 
 

--- Page 159 ---
124    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
equivalent of 100 mCg of ethinyl estradiol plus 500 mCg of 
levonorgestrel. Twelve hours later, take the same dose. For more 
precise instructions for a particular combination pill, refer to https://
ec.princeton.edu.
	
(4)	 Copper IUD may be inserted within 120 hours of coitus.
	
f.	 Guidelines:
	
(1)	 Counseling about EC should be a routine part of anticipatory 
guidance for all female and male adolescents. Advance prescrip-
tions should be considered for all adolescents.
	
(2)	 Antiemetics can be used to prevent nausea and should be used 
prophylactically in the Yuzpe regimen.
	
(3)	 May be combined with other ongoing methods of birth control.
	
(4)	 OCPs may be started immediately after progestin-­only or com-
bined hormonal EC dosing has been completed. DMPA may be 
given the same day.
	
(5)	 Patient should abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier 
contraception for 7 days (14 if using ulipristal) or until next men-
ses, whichever comes first.
	
(6)	 Scheduled follow-­up is not required after use of EC. However, 
women whose menses are delayed by a week or more, or have 
any signs of pregnancy (e.g., irregular menses, abdominal cramp-
ing), should be evaluated clinically or have a pregnancy test.
6.	 Follow-­up recommendations for contraception: Two or three visits per 
year to monitor compliance, blood pressure, side effects, and satisfac-
tion with chosen birth control option. 
E.  Pregnancy49,50
If pregnancy is suspected in an adolescent patient, take a sexual history 
and explore how the patient feels about a possible pregnancy in order to 
guide the rest of the visit.
	1.	 Diagnosis:
	
a.	 Perform urine hCG testing to diagnose the pregnancy. False-­positives 
and false-­negatives are possible; repeat urine testing or serum hCG 
testing may be indicated.
	
b.	 If pregnancy is diagnosed, estimate the gestational age using the 
LMP. Confirm with a brief exam of uterine size. When in doubt, 
arrange an ultrasound and obstetric consultation promptly, as gesta-
tional age will affect counseling options.
	
c.	 Share the diagnosis with the patient privately. Encourage them to 
involve a parent or legal guardian and facilitate the discussion, if nec-
essary. Be familiar with local confidentiality laws, which vary by state.
	
d.	 Review the patient’s medications to ensure they are safe for preg-
nancy. Start patient on prenatal vitamin if not taking.
	2.	 Prenatal testing: All pregnant adolescents should be tested for HIV, 
syphilis, hepatitis B, chlamydia, and gonorrhea at the first prenatal visit. 
If an infection is suspected or if there may be a delay in obstetric care, 
the pediatrician should perform the testing.

Chapter 5  Adolescent Medicine    125

	3.	 Options counseling: Counsel the adolescent on the importance of mak-
ing a timely decision. The options depend on gestational age, but may 
include continuing the pregnancy and raising the infant, continuing the 
pregnancy and making an adoption plan, or terminating the pregnancy. 
If a pediatrician has personal limitations in offering a discussion of all 
three options, he/she should make a prompt referral to a colleague or 
consultant. Medical and surgical abortion may be available depending on 
the gestational age of the pregnancy and coexisting medical conditions. 
Medical abortion is generally available under 9 weeks of gestation; surgi-
cal abortion is generally available under 20 to 24 weeks of gestation.
	4.	 Complications: First trimester complications include ectopic preg-
nancy and spontaneous abortion; immediate obstetric referral may be 
indicated for abdominal pain and/or vaginal bleeding in the pregnant 
patient. 
III.  TRANSITIONING ADOLESCENTS INTO ADULT CARE51
All adolescents, particularly those with special healthcare needs or chronic 
conditions, benefit from careful attention to the process of transitioning to adult 
care. Transition planning should routinely occur during well-­visits and should 
start at age 12. Resources for how to approach and organize the transition 
process including guidance on transition readiness and planning are available 
at http://www.gottransition.org/. See Chapter 9 for discussion of transition to 
adult care for youth with developmental disorders and disabilities.

OBTAINING THE SEXUAL HISTORY: THE FIVE PS
	1.	 Partners
 
• 
“Do you have sex with men, women, or both?”
 
• 
“In the past 2 months, how many partners have you had sex with?”
 
• 
“In the past 12 months, how many partners have you had sex with?”
 
• 
“Is it possible that any of your sex partners in the past 12 months had sex 
with someone else while they were still in a sexual relationship with you?”
	2.	 Prevention of Pregnancy
 
• 
“What are you doing to prevent pregnancy?”
	3.	 Protection from STIs
 
• 
“What do you do to protect yourself from STIs including HIV?”
	4.	 Practices
 
• 
“To understand your risk for STIs, I need to understand the kind of sex 
you have had recently.”
 
• 
“Have you had vaginal sex, meaning ‘penis in vagina sex’?” If yes, “Do 
you use condoms: never, sometimes, or always?”
 
• 
“Have you had anal sex, meaning “penis in rectum/anus sex”?” If yes, 
“Do you use condoms: never, sometimes, or always?”
 
• 
“Have you had oral sex, meaning ‘mouth on penis/vagina sex’?”
 
• 
“Have you had vaginal or anal sex using fingers or sex toys?”
For condom answers:
 
• 
If “never”: “Why don’t you use condoms?”
 
• 
If “sometimes”: “In what situations, or with whom, do you not use condoms?”
	5.	 Past History of STIs
 
• 
“Have you ever had an STI?”
 
• 
“Have any of your partners had an STI?”
Additional questions to identify HIV and viral hepatitis risk include:
 
• 
“Have you or any of your partners ever injected drugs?”
 
• 
“Have any of your partners exchanged money or drugs for sex?”
 
• 
“Is there anything else about your sexual practices I need to know about?”

I.  PAIN ASSESSMENT
A.  Infant1
	1.	 Physiologic response
	
a.	 Characterized by oxygen desaturation, crying, diaphoresis, flushing or 
pallor, and increases in blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate.
	
b.	 Seen primarily in acute pain; subsides with continuing/chronic pain.
	2.	 Behavioral response
	
a.	 Observe characteristics and duration of cry, facial expressions, visual 
tracking, body movements, and response to stimuli.
	
b.	 Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS): Behavioral assessment tool for 
the preterm neonate and full-­term neonate up to 6 weeks after birth.
	
c.	 FLACC scale (Table 6.1): Measures and evaluates pain interven-
tions by quantifying pain behaviors, including Facial expression, Leg 
movement, Activity, Cry, and Consolability, with scores ranging from 0 
to 10.2 The Revised FLACC scale is reliable in children with cognitive 
impairment.3 
B.  Preschooler
In addition to physiologic and behavioral responses, the FACES pain scale 
revised (FPS-­R) can be used to assess pain intensity in children as young 
as 3 years of age by having the patient point to the image on the scale that 
best characterizes their pain (Fig. 6.1). 
C.  School-­Age and Adolescent
Evaluate physiologic and behavioral responses; ask about description, loca-
tion, and character of pain. Starting at the age of 7 years, children can use 
the standard subjective pain rating scale, in which 0 is no pain and 10 is 
the worst pain ever experienced. 
II.  ANALGESICS1
A.  Safety
	1.	 Combined Analgesics
	
a.	 Danger of acetaminophen toxicity when using combined opioid-­
acetaminophen products (oxycodone or hydrocodone with 
acetaminophen).
 

--- Page 166 ---
Chapter 6  Analgesia and Procedural Sedation    127
6
	
b.	 Preferable to prescribe opioids and acetaminophen separately.
	2.	 Codeine
	
a.	 Not recommended for use in children.
	
b.	 Five percent of the population show ultra-­rapid metabolism of 
codeine to morphine (the active metabolite), which can lead to dan-
gerously high levels. This is especially unsafe after tonsillectomy and 
adenoidectomy (T&A) performed for sleep apnea.4
TABLE 6.1
FLACC PAIN ASSESSMENT TOOL
FACE
0—No particular expression or smile
1—Occasional grimace or frown, withdrawn, disinterested
2—Frequent to constant frown, quivering chin, clenched jaw
LEGS
0—Normal position or relaxed
1—Uneasy, restless, tense
2—Kicking or legs drawn up
ACTIVITY
0—Lying quietly, normal position, moves easily
1—Squirming, shifting back and forth, tense
2—Arched, rigid, or jerking
CRY
0—No cry (awake or asleep)
1—Moans or whimpers, occasional complaint
2—Crying steadily, screams or sobs, frequent complaints
CONSOLABILITY
0—Content, relaxed
1—Reassured by occasional touching, hugging, or being talked to; distractible
2—Difficult to console or comfort

128    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	
c.	 Little to no analgesic effect in newborns and approximately 10% of 
the U.S. population.5
	3.	 Meperidine
	
a.	 Not recommended for use in children due to risk of neurotoxicity 
(agitation, tremors, myoclonus, and seizures), especially when renal 
dysfunction is present.6
	
b.	 Contraindicated in patients receiving monoamine oxidase (MAO) 
inhibitors.
	4.	 Tramadol
	
a.	 Opioid pain reliever, with additional effects on nonopioid receptors.
	
b.	 May be over-­metabolized to an active opiate metabolite, resulting in 
potentially fatal respiratory depression.
	
c.	 In 2017, the FDA issued its strongest warning against use in chil-
dren; therefore, administration is considered off-­label.7 
B.  Nonopioid Analgesics
Weak analgesics with antipyretic activity are commonly used to manage 
mild to moderate pain of nonvisceral origin. Can be administered alone or 
in combination with opioids.
	1.	 Acetaminophen [by mouth (PO)/per rectum (PR)/intravenous (IV)]: Weak 
analgesic with no antiinflammatory activity, platelet inhibition, or gastro-
intestinal (GI) irritation. Hepatotoxicity can occur with high doses.
	2.	 Aspirin (PO/PR): Associated with platelet inhibition and GI irritation. 
Avoid for analgesia in pediatrics due to risk of Reye syndrome.
	3.	 Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Ibuprofen (PO/IV), 
ketorolac [IV/intramuscular (IM)/PO/intranasal (IN)], naproxen (PO), 
diclofenac (PO/IV), and celecoxib (PO).
	
a.	 Use with extreme caution in children less than 6 months of age due 
to concern for adverse GI effects and risk of renal failure.
	
b.	 Especially useful for sickle cell disease, bony, rheumatic, and inflam-
matory pain.
	
c.	 Concurrent histamine-­2-­receptor blocker or proton pump inhibitor is 
recommended with prolonged use given GI side effects.
	
d.	 Other adverse effects include interference with platelet aggrega-
tion, hepatitis, bronchoconstriction, hypersensitivity reactions, and 
azotemia. Avoid in patients with severe renal disease, dehydration, or 
heart failure.
NOTE: Ketorolac is a potent analgesic. Limit duration of therapy to less than 
5 days to limit renal toxicity. 
C.  Opioids (Table 6.2)
	1.	 Produce analgesia by binding to μ receptors in the brain and spinal 
cord.
	2.	 Side effects: Pruritus, nausea, vomiting, constipation, urine retention, 
and (rarely) respiratory depression and hypotension. Prescribe a bowel 
regimen when prescribing opioids.

130    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	3.	 Patients with renal failure.
	
a.	 Morphine: Avoid use secondary to decreased excretion of the active 
metabolite that can result in respiratory depression.
	
b.	 Preferred choices: Fentanyl, remifentanil, methadone, hydromor-
phone, oxycodone.
	4.	 Long-­acting opioids (methadone, extended-­release tablets, and 
patches) are not recommended for acute pain.
	5.	 Although opioids are essential for the treatment of moderate to severe 
pain, a thoughtful approach is recommended with the quantity that 
is dispensed, as studies have shown that over 50% of opioid doses 
dispensed are not consumed.8 There is need for further research to 
develop evidence-­based opioid prescribing guidelines for treating acute 
pain in children. 
D.  Local Anesthetics9–12
Administered topically or subcutaneously to surround peripheral nerves 
(peripheral block) or centrally (epidural/spinal block). Temporarily block 
nerve conduction at the sodium channel.
	1.	 For all local anesthetics, 1% solution = 10 mg/mLb
	2.	 Topical local anesthetics (Table 6.3)12
	3.	 Injectable local anesthetics (Table 6.4):
	
a.	 Subcutaneous infiltration of the skin at the site: Used for painful 
procedures such as wound closure or lumbar puncture.
	
b.	 Use of a 27-­ to 30-­gauge needle, alkalization, warming the solution 
to 37°C to 42°C, and a slow injection can reduce stinging from injec-
tion. Alkalinize by adding 1 mL (1 mEqc) sodium bicarbonate to 9 mL 
lidocaine (or 29 mL bupivacaine).
	
c.	 To enhance efficacy and duration, add epinephrine (5 to 10 mCgd of 
epinephrine to 1 mL of local anesthetic) to decrease vascular uptake. 
Never use local anesthetics with epinephrine in areas supplied by end 
arteries (e.g., pinna, fingers, toes, nasal tip, penis).
	
d.	 Maximum volume (mL) = (maximum mg/kg dose × weight in kg)/(% 
solution × 10). See Table 6.4 for maximum doses.
	
e.	 Toxicity: Central nervous system (CNS) and cardiac toxicity are of 
greatest concern. CNS symptoms are seen before cardiovascular col-
lapse. Always calculate the maximum volume of the local anesthetic 
and always draw up less than that. Bupivacaine is associated with 
more severe cardiac toxicity than lidocaine.
	
(1)	 Progression of symptoms: Perioral numbness → dizziness → 
auditory disturbances → muscular twitching → unconscious-
ness → seizures → coma → respiratory arrest → cardiovascular 
collapse.

(e)	 Treat hypotension and bradycardia—start cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation (CPR) if pulseless. Avoid hyperventilation.
	
(3)	 If concerned for systemic toxicity, contact an anesthesiologist 
and call poison control (1-­800-­222-­1222). 
E.  Nonpharmacologic Measures of Pain Relief13,14
	1.	 Sucrose for neonates (Sweet-­Ease):
	
a.	 Indications: Painful minor procedures (heel lance, venipuncture, 
and intramuscular injection) in neonates and infants. Has not been 
shown to be effective for relief of circumcision pain. Strongest 
evidence for infants aged 0 to 1 month,13 but additional evidence 
suggests efficacy up to 12 months.14
	
b.	 Procedure: Administer up to 2 mL of 24% sucrose into the infant’s 
mouth by syringe or from a nipple/pacifier ∼2 minutes before the 
procedure. Effective doses in very low-­birth-­weight infants may be as 
low as 0.05 to 0.1 mL.
	
c.	 An additional dose may be administered within a relatively short 
period of time for multiple procedures, but it should not be adminis-
tered more than twice in 1 hour.
	
d.	 Use along with other age-­appropriate nonpharmacologic measures 
listed below.
	
e.	 Avoid if patient is unable to appropriately feed by mouth or cannot 
safely handle oral secretions.
	2.	 Other: Parental presence/holding, distraction with toys, child life spe-
cialists, guided meditation/coping skills, virtual reality simulations. 
III.  PATIENT-­CONTROLLED ANALGESIA (PCA)
A.  Definition
PCA enables a patient to receive a limited number of small doses (boluses) 
of an analgesic with or without a continuous (basal) infusion on an as-­
needed basis. In children younger than 6 years old or with physical/mental 
disability, a family member, caregiver, or nurse may administer supplemen-
tal (bolus) doses. 
B.  Indications
	1.	 Moderate to severe pain of acute or chronic nature. Commonly used in 
sickle cell disease, postsurgery, posttrauma, burns, and cancer.
	2.	 Useful for preemptive pain management (e.g., dressing changes). 
C.  Routes of Administration
	IV	or epidural 
D.  Agents (Table 6.5)
E. Adjuvants
	1.	 Low-­dose naloxone (Narcan) infusion reduces incidence of pruritus and 
nausea associated with narcotic administration.
 

--- Page 173 ---
134    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	2.	 Low-­dose ketamine infusion has a narcotic sparing effect. It is espe-
cially helpful in chemotherapy-­induced mucositis, visceral pain, and 
neuropathic pain. Its mechanism of action is by N-­methyl-­D-­aspartate 
(NMDA) blockade. May be used with or as an alternative to methadone. 
F.  Side Effects of Opioid Patient-­Controlled Analgesia
Pruritus, nausea, constipation, urine retention, excessive drowsiness, and 
respiratory depression. 
IV.  OPIOID TAPERING
A.  Indications
Because of the development of dependence and potential for withdrawal, 
a tapering schedule is required if the patient has received frequent opioid 
analgesics for >5 days. 
B.  Withdrawal
	1.	 See Box 18.1 for symptoms of opioid withdrawal.
	2.	 Onset of signs and symptoms: 6 to 12 hours after the last dose of mor-
phine and 36 to 48 hours after the last dose of methadone.
	3.	 Duration: 7 to 14 days, with a peak intensity reached within 2 to 4 days. 
C.  Recommendations for Tapering
	1.	 Conversion: All drugs should be converted to a single equi-­analgesic 
member of that group (see Table 6.2).
	2.	 PCA wean: Drug dosing should be changed from continuous/intermit-
tent IV infusion to PO basal/bolus therapy. If the patient is on PCA, once 
the first PO dose is administered, the PCA basal infusion should be 
stopped 30 to 60 minutes later. PCA bolus doses should be continued 
but reduced by 25% to 50%. If no further bolus doses are administered 
in the next 6 hours, the PCA should be discontinued. If the patient 
continues to experience pain, consider increasing scheduled PO dose, 
administering a rescue one-­time PO bolus dose, or adding an adjuvant 
analgesic (e.g., NSAID).
	3.	 Slow dose decrease: During an intermittent IV/PO wean, the total daily 
dose should be decreased by 10% to 20% of the original dose every 1 
to 2 days (e.g., to taper a morphine dose of 40 mg/day, decrease the 
daily dose by 4 to 8 mg every 1 to 2 days).

	4.	 Oral regimen: If not done previously, IV dosing should be converted to 
equivalent PO administration 1 to 2 days before discharge, and titration 
should be continued as outlined previously.
	5.	 Adjunctive therapy:
	
a.	 Clonidine in combination with an opioid decreases the length of time 
needed for opioid weaning in neonatal abstinence syndrome, with 
few short-­term side effects. Long-­term safety has yet to be thor-
oughly investigated, but follow-­up after 1 year on motor, cognitive, 
and language scores showed no difference in those treated with 
clonidine.15,16
	
b.	 PO and transdermal clonidine have a potential role for sedation, 
analgesia, and iatrogenic drug withdrawal in critically ill children, 
but current reports are retrospective or small clinical trials with 
significant heterogeneity in dosing, so further research is necessary. 
Transdermal dosing should not be used in children aged <1 year due 
to altered skin absorption.17
	
c.	 Studies have shown efficacy of α2-­adrenergic agonists in treating opi-
oid withdrawal and reducing doses of methadone, but the duration 
of treatment was longer with α2-­adrenergic agonists, and there were 
fewer adverse effects with methadone.18
	
d.	 Dexmedetomidine is an α2-­adrenoreceptor agonist, which produces 
sedation and mild analgesia, with minimal to no respiratory depres-
sion. Administered as a continuous infusion, it has been shown to 
reduce opioid requirements and facilitate opioid weaning. 
D.  Examples
See Box EC 6.A for example of opioid wean.
 
V.  PROCEDURAL SEDATION1,9–12,19–21
A.  Definitions
	1.	 Mild sedation (anxiolysis): Intent is anxiolysis with maintenance of 
consciousness.
	2.	 Moderate sedation: Formerly known as conscious sedation. A con-
trolled state of depressed consciousness during which airway reflexes 
and patency are maintained. Patient responds appropriately to 
age-­appropriate commands (e.g., “Open your eyes”) and light touch. 
Practically obtained any time a combination of a sedative-­hypnotic and 
an analgesic are used.
	3.	 Deep sedation: A controlled state of depressed consciousness during 
which airway reflexes and patency may not be maintained, and the 
child is unable to respond to physical or verbal stimuli. In practice, deep 
sedation is required for most painful procedures in children. Practically 
obtained with propofol.
	4.	 Dissociative sedation: Unique state of sedation achieved with ket-
amine characterized by a deep level of depressed consciousness and 
 

--- Page 175 ---
136    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
analgesia. Airway reflexes and patency are generally maintained; how-
ever, excessive oral secretions may become problematic, occasionally 
resulting in micro-­aspiration or laryngospasm. 
B.  Preparation
	 1.	 The patient should be NPO for solids and liquids (Table 6.6).19 Per 
American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and American Academy 
of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines, children receiving moderate sedation 
for elective procedures should follow the same fasting guidelines as 
those for general anesthesia.20,22 For urgent/emergent sedation when 
children are not NPO, the risks of sedation and possible aspiration 
must be balanced against the benefits of performing the procedure 
promptly. Recent studies suggest that NPO status for liquids and solids 
may not be statistically associated with aspiration, although studies are 
limited as aspiration is a relatively uncommon complication.23
	 2.	 Focused patient history:
	
a.	 Allergies, medications, and any history of a previous reaction to 
anesthesia or sedation.
	
b.	 Assess for the possibility of an adverse airway event occurring 
with sedation (hypoxemia, hypercarbia, inability to mask venti-
late, etc.). This can occur from: (1) mechanical airway obstruc-
tion (micrognathia, tonsillar and/or adenoid hypertrophy, large 
tongue, history of snoring, presence of noisy breathing, diagnosis 
of obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, presence of a craniofacial 
syndrome), (2) lung disease (history of prematurity, chronic lung 
disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia, asthma), or (3) presence 
of a recent upper respiratory infection (URI). A history of a URI 
increases the risk of laryngospasm and/or bronchospasm; there-
fore, one must weigh the risks/benefits of providing sedation after 
a recent URI versus need for immediate interventional procedure. 
For elective procedures requiring sedation, it is best to wait 2 to 
4 weeks after resolution of illness to reduce the risk of an adverse 
event.24
	
c.	 Assess aspiration risk (neuromuscular disease, esophageal disease, 
altered mental status, obesity, pregnancy).

EXAMPLE OF OPIOID TAPERING
Patient on morphine patient-­controlled analgesia (PCA) to be converted to oral 
(PO) morphine with home weaning.
For example: morphine PCA basal rate = 2 mg/hr, average bolus rate = 0.5 mg/hr
Step 1: Calculate daily dose: basal + bolus = (2 mg/hr × 24 hr) + (0.5 mg/hr × 
24 hr) = 60 mg intravenous (IV) morphine
Step 2: Convert according to drug potency: morphine IV/morphine oral = 
approx. 3:1 potency; 3 × 60 mg = 180 mg PO morphine
Step 3: Prescribe 90 mg BID or 60 mg TID; wean 10%–20% of original dose 
(30 mg) every 1–2 days
BID, Twice daily; IV, intravenous; mg, milligram; PCA, patient controlled analgesia; PO, by mouth; 
TID, three times daily.

d.	 Presence of kidney/liver disease (may prolong sedative effect) and 
cardiac disease (potential for hemodynamic instability with sedative 
administration).
	 3.	 Physical examination: Specific attention to mouth opening and neck 
extension. Use the Mallampati classification system to assess the airway 
for likelihood of difficult direct laryngoscopy and intubation (Fig. 6.3).
	 4.	 Determine ASA Physical Status Classification (Table 6.7): Class I and 
II patients are generally good candidates for mild, moderate, or deep 
sedation outside of the operating room.20

	 5.	 Always have an emergency plan ready:
	
a.	 Make sure qualified backup personnel and equipment are close by.
	
b.	 Complications most often occur 5 to 10 minutes after admin-
istration of IV medication and immediately after a procedure is 
completed (when the stimuli associated with the procedure are 
removed).11
	 6.	 Personnel: Two providers are required. One provider should perform 
the procedure, and a separate provider should monitor the patient dur-
ing sedation and recovery.
	 7.	 Ensure IV access prior to induction by flushing with saline. 
Subcutaneous infiltration of a sedative can cause unpredictable or 
prolonged sedation.
	 8.	 Have airway/intubation equipment immediately available (see Chapter 
1).
	 9.	 Emergency medications: Always have emergency medications for rapid 
sequence intubation and CPR immediately available.
	10.	 Reversal agents should be readily available (naloxone, flumazenil). 
C.  Monitoring
	1.	 Vital signs: Baseline vital signs should be obtained. Heart rate, 
oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate should be continuously 
monitored, and blood pressure monitored intermittently (every 3 to 
5 minutes) until a pre-­sedation level of consciousness is achieved. 
NOTE: Unrecognized apnea is often followed by desaturation within 
1 to 2 minutes when not receiving supplemental oxygenation. 
Administration of supplemental oxygen can further delay recognition 
of apnea because the onset of desaturation may occur more than 2 
minutes after apnea.
	2.	 Airway: Airway patency and adequacy of ventilation should be fre-
quently assessed through capnography (e.g., continuous end-­tidal

carbon dioxide [CO2]), auscultation, and direct visualization. This can 
help ensure immediate recognition of apnea, and appropriate measures 
may be taken before desaturation occurs. 
D.  Pharmacologic Agents
	1.	 Goal of procedural sedation: The administration of medications to pro-
vide appropriate levels of analgesia, sedation, and anxiolysis so that the 
procedure can occur without the need to secure the airway.
	2.	 CNS, cardiovascular, and respiratory depression may always occur; 
occurs more commonly when combining sedative drugs and/or opioids, 
or with rapid drug administration. It is always best to titrate medications 
to the desired level of sedation.
	3.	 Common sedative/hypnotic agents (Box 6.1). Also see Table 6.2 
and Table 6.8 for more information on opioids and barbiturates/
benzodiazepines.
	4.	 Reversal agents:
	
a.	 Naloxone: Opioid antagonist. See Box 6.2 for naloxone administration 
protocol.
	
b.	 Flumazenil: Benzodiazepine antagonist. 
E.  Discharge Criteria20
	1.	 The patient can maintain a patent airway without requiring supple-
mental oxygen. There should also be no compromise in cardiovascular 
function.
	2.	 The patient should be easily arousable with intact protective airway 
reflexes (swallow, cough, and gag).
	3.	 The patient should have the ability to talk and sit up unaided (if age 
appropriate). Alternatively, for very young or intellectually disabled chil-
dren, the goal is to return to their pre-­sedation level of responsiveness.
	4.	 Ensure ability to maintain adequate hydration (i.e., the patient can toler-
ate enteral fluids).

Benzodiazepines
 • 
Reversible with flumazenil
 • 
Anxiolytic effects; no analgesic effects 
Opioids
 • 
Reversible with naloxone
 • 
Analgesic effects; no anxiolytic effects 
Ketamine1,10–13
 • 
Causes potent dissociative amnesia and analgesia
 • 
Nystagmus indicates likely therapeutic effect
 • 
Vocalizations/movement may occur even with adequate sedation
 • 
Onset: IV, 0.5–2 min; IM, 5–10 min; PO/PR, 20–45 min
 • 
Duration: IV, 20–60 min; IM, 30–90 min; PO/PR, 60–120+ min
 • 
CNS effects: Emergence delirium with auditory, visual, and tactile 
hallucinations
 • 
Cardiovascular effects: Inhibits catecholamine reuptake, thereby causing 
increased HR, BP, SVR, and PVR. Rarely causes hemodynamic instability; 
however, in catecholamine-­deplete patients (e.g., shock) it can cause direct 
myocardial depression and hypotension.
 • 
Respiratory effects: Bronchodilation (useful in asthmatics), increased secre-
tions (can result in laryngospasm), maintenance of ventilatory response to 
hypoxia, relative maintenance of airway reflexes
 • 
Other effects: Increased muscle tone, myoclonic jerks, nausea, emesis
 • 
Contraindications: Hypertension and preexisting psychotic disorders. 
Controversy exists on its safety in patients with elevated ICP or IOP. Evidence 
suggesting ketamine elevates intracranial pressure or causes harm in these 
patients is limited. 
Propofol
 • 
For deep sedation or general anesthesia
 • 
Administered as single or multiple IV boluses +/− infusion
 • 
Rapid onset and brief recovery (5–15 min) with bolus administration
 • 
Can have antiemetic and euphoric effects
 • 
Caution: Respiratory depression, apnea, hypotension
 • 
Anxiolytic; no analgesic effects 
Dexmedetomidine
 • 
Give IV load over 10 min, followed by infusion.
 • 
Dexmedetomidine can also be given intranasally. It will take 30–60 min to 
attain natural sleep, and patients will briefly awaken with stimulation.
 • 
Rapid onset and brief recovery (5–15 min)
 • 
Does not cause respiratory depression or apnea. Can cause hypotension and 
bradycardia, especially when IV load given too quickly.
 • 
Anxiolytic and analgesic effects
 • 
Increased cost compared with other medications 
Nitrous Oxide

BOX 6.2
NALOXONE (NARCAN) ADMINISTRATIONa
Indications: Patients Requiring Naloxone (Narcan) Usually Meet All the 
Following Criteria
 • 
Shallow respirations or respiratory rate <8 breaths/minb
 • 
Pinpoint pupils
 • 
Unresponsive to physical stimulation 
Procedure
	1.	 Stop opioid administration (as well as other sedative drugs), assess ABCs 
(Airway, Breathing, Circulation), and call for help.
	2.	 Dilute naloxone:
	
a.	 If child >40 kg: Mix 0.4 mg (1 ampule) of naloxone with 9 mL of normal 
saline (final concentration 0.04 mg/mL = 40 mCg/mL)
	
b.	 If child <40 kg: Mix 0.4 mg (1 ampule) of naloxone with 9 mL of normal 
saline to make a concentration of 40 mCg/mL (as above). Then, repeat 
dilution by mixing 1 mL of the 40 mCg/mL solution with 9 mL of normal 
saline for final concentration of 4 mCg/mL.
	3.	 Administer and observe response: Administer dilute naloxone slowly (1–2 mCg/
kg/dose IV over 2 minutes). Observe patient response.
	4.	 Titrate to effect: Within 1–2 minutes, patient should open eyes and respond. 
If not, continue until a total dose of 10 mCg/kg is given. If no response is 
obtained, evaluate for other cause of sedation/respiratory depression.
	5.	 Discontinue naloxone administration: Discontinue naloxone as soon as patient 
responds (e.g., takes deep breaths when directed).
	6.	 Caution: Another dose of naloxone may be required within 30 min of first dose 
(duration of action of naloxone is shorter than that of most opioids).
	7.	 Monitor patient: Assign a staff member to monitor sedation/respiratory status 
and remind patient to take deep breaths as necessary.
	8.	 Alternative analgesia: Provide nonopioids for pain relief. Resume opioid 
administration at half the original dose when the patient is easily aroused, and 
respiratory rate is >9 breaths/min.
aNaloxone administration for patients being treated for pain. Higher doses may be necessary for 
patients found in the community or those with signs of cardiopulmonary failure. Please see formu-
lary for additional dosing.
bRespiratory rates that require naloxone vary according to infant’s/child’s usual rate.

EXAMPLES OF SEDATION PROTOCOLS
Protocol/Doses
Comments
Ketamine × 1–3 doses
Lowest rates of adverse events when ketamine used alonea
Ketamine + midazolam + atropine 
(“ketazolam”)
Atropine = antisialagogue
Midazolam = counters emergence delirium
Can be given IM or IV. If giving IM, combine all 3 agents in 
1 syringe (using the smallest volume possible, preferably 
<3 mL total).
  Ketamine × 1–3 doses
  Midazolam × 1 dose
  Atropine × 1 dose
Midazolam + fentanyl
High likelihood of respiratory depression
Give fentanyl no more frequently than every 3 min
Risk of rigid chest—give no faster than 1 mCg/kg/min
  Midazolam × 3 doses PRN
  Fentanyl × 3 doses PRN

I.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
A.  Heart Rate
Refer to the inside front cover for normal heart rate (HR) by age. 
B.  Blood Pressure
	1.	 Blood pressure (BP):
See Tables 7.1 and 7.2 for normal BP values (systolic blood pressure 
[SBP], diastolic blood pressure [DBP]) by age.1,2
	2.	 Mean arterial pressure (MAP)
	
a.	 MAP = diastolic pressure + (pulse pressure/3) OR 1/3 systolic 
­pressure + 2/3 diastolic pressure.
	
b.	 Preterm infants and newborns: Normal MAP = gestational age in 
weeks + 5.
	3.	 Abnormalities in BP
	
a.	 Four-­limb BP measurements can be used to assess for coarctation of 
the aorta.
	
b.	 Pulsus paradoxus: Exaggeration of the normal drop in SBP with 
inspiration. Determine SBP at the end of exhalation and during 
inhalation; difference >10 mmHg consider pericardial effusion, tam-
ponade, pericarditis, severe asthma, or restrictive cardiomyopathies.
	4.	 Hypertension (HTN)
	
a.	 See Chapter 1 for management of acute HTN.
	
b.	 See Chapter 19 for screening, work-­up, and management of chronic 
HTN. 
C.  Heart Sounds
	1.	 S1: Associated with closure of mitral and tricuspid valves; heard best at 
the apex or left lower sternal border (LLSB).
	2.	 S2: Associated with closure of pulmonary and aortic valves; heard best 
at the left upper sternal border (LUSB) and has normal physiologic split-
ting that increases with inspiration.
	3.	 S3: Heard best at the apex or LLSB.
	4.	 S4: Heard at the apex. 
D.  Systolic and Diastolic Sounds
See Box 7.1 for abnormal heart sounds.3 
E.  Murmurs4

	1.	 Grading of heart murmurs: Intensified by states of higher cardiac output 
(e.g., anemia, anxiety, fever, exercise).3
	
a.	 Grade I: Barely audible
	
b.	 Grade II: Murmur softer than heart sounds, but audible
	
c.	 Grade III: Murmur moderately loud, equally loud as heart sounds, 
not accompanied by a thrill
	
d.	 Grade IV: Murmur louder than heart sounds, associated with a thrill
	
e.	 Grade V: Audible with a stethoscope barely on the chest
	
f.	 Grade VI: Audible with a stethoscope off the chest
	2.	 Benign heart murmurs4:
	
a.	 Caused by a disturbance of the laminar flow of blood; frequently produced 
as the diameter of the blood’s pathway decreases and velocity increases.
	
b.	 Present in >80% of children sometime during childhood, most com-
monly beginning at age 3 to 4 years.
	
c.	 Accentuated in high-­output states, especially with fever and anemia.
	
d.	 Normal electrocardiogram (ECG) and radiographic findings.
NOTE: ECG and chest radiograph are not routinely used, nor are they 
cost-­effective screening tools for distinguishing benign from pathologic 
murmurs.
BOX 7.1
SUMMARY OF ABNORMAL HEART SOUNDS
 • 
Widely split S1: Ebstein anomaly, RBBB
 • 
Widely split and fixed S2: Right ventricular volume overload (e.g., ASD, 
PAPVR), pressure overload (e.g., PS), electrical delay in RV contraction (e.g., 
RBBB), early aortic closure (e.g., MR), occasionally heard in normal child
 • 
Narrowly split S2: Pulmonary hypertension, AS, delay in LV contraction (e.g., 
LBBB), occasionally heard in normal child
 • 
Single S2: Pulmonary hypertension, one semilunar valve (e.g., pulmonary 
atresia, aortic atresia, truncus arteriosus), P2 not audible (e.g., TGA, TOF, 
severe PS), severe AS, occasionally heard in normal child
 • 
Paradoxically split S2: Severe AS, LBBB, Wolff-­Parkinson-­White syndrome (type B)
 • 
Abnormal intensity of P2: Increased P2 (e.g., pulmonary hypertension), 
decreased P2 (e.g., severe PS, TOF, TS)
 • 
S3: Occasionally heard in healthy children or adults or may indicate dilated 
ventricles (e.g., large VSD, CHF)
 • 
S4: Always pathologic, indicative of decreased ventricular compliance
 • 
Ejection click: Heard with stenosis of the semilunar valves, dilated great arter-
ies in the setting of pulmonary or systemic HTN, idiopathic dilation of the PA, 
TOF, persistent truncus arteriosus
 • 
Midsystolic click: Heard at the apex in mitral valve prolapse
 • 
Diastolic opening snap: Rare in children; associated with TS/MS
AS, Aortic stenosis; ASD, atrial septal defect; CHF, congestive heart failure; LBBB, left bundle-­
branch block; LV, left ventricle; MR, mitral regurgitation; MS, mitral stenosis; PA, pulmonary artery;

II.  ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY
A.  Basic Electrocardiography Principles
	1.	 Lead placement (Fig. 7.1)
	2.	 ECG complexes
	
a.	 P wave: Represents atrial depolarization.
	
b.	 QRS complex: Represents ventricular depolarization.
	
c.	 T wave: Represents ventricular repolarization.
	
d.	 U wave: May follow the T wave and represents late phases of ven-
tricular repolarization.
	3.	 Systematic approach for evaluating ECGs (Table 7.4 shows normal ECG 
parameters):3,5
	
a.	 Rate
 

--- Page 201 ---
158    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	
(1)	 Standardization: Paper speed is 25 mm/sec. One small square 
= 1 mm = 0.04 second. One large square = 5 mm = 0.2 second. 
Amplitude standard: 10 mm = 1 mV.
	
(2)	 Calculation: HR (beats/min) = 60 divided by the average R-­R inter-
val in seconds, or 1500 divided by the R-­R interval in millimeters.
	
b.	 Rhythm
	
(1)	 Sinus rhythm: Every QRS complex is preceded by a P wave, 
normal PR interval (although PR interval may be prolonged, as in 
first-­degree atrioventricular [AV] block), and normal P-­wave axis 
(upright P in leads I and aVF).

(2)	 There is normal respiratory variation of the R-­R interval without 
morphologic changes of the P wave or QRS complex.
	
c.	 Axis: The direction of the QRS in leads I and aVF should be 
observed, the quadrant determined, and comparison made with age-­
matched normal values (Fig. 7.2 and Table 7.4).
	
d.	 Intervals (PR, QRS, QTc)
	
(1)	 See Table 7.4 for normal PR and QRS intervals.
	
(2)	 The QTc is calculated using the Bazett formula: QTc = QT (sec) 
measured/√R-­R (the average of three measurements taken from 
the same lead, usually lead II).
	
(3)	 The QT interval is measured from the beginning of the QRS com-
plex to the end of the T wave. Divide this value by the square 
root of the preceding R-­R interval to obtain the QTc.
	
(4)	 Normal values for QTc are:
	
(a)	 0.44 second is the 97th percentile for infants 3 to 4 days old.6
	
(b)	 ≤0.45 second in all males aged >1 week and in prepubes-
cent females.
	
(c)	 ≤0.46 second for postpubescent females.
	
e.	 P-­wave size and shape: A normal P wave should be <0.10 second in 
children and <0.08 second in infants, with an amplitude of <0.3 mV 
(3 mm in height, with normal standardization).
	
f.	 R-­wave progression: In general, there is a normal increase in R-­wave 
size and a decrease in S-­wave size from leads V1 to V6 (with dominant S 
waves in the right precordial leads and dominant R waves in the left pre-
cordial leads), representing dominance of left ventricular forces. However, 
newborns and infants have a normal dominance of the right ventricle.
	
g.	 Q waves: Normal Q waves are usually <0.04 second in duration and 
<25% of the total QRS amplitude. Q waves are <5 mm deep in the 
left precordial leads and aVF, and ≤8 mm deep in lead III for children 
age <3 years.

BOX 7.3
VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY CRITERIA
Right Ventricular Hypertrophy (RVH) Criteria
Must Have at Least One of the Following:
Upright T wave in lead V1 after 3 days of age to adolescence
Presence of Q wave in V1 (QR or QRS pattern)
Increased right and anterior QRS voltage (with normal QRS duration):
R in lead V1, >98th percentile for age
S in lead V6, >98th percentile for age
Right ventricular strain (associated with inverted T wave in V1 with tall R wave) 
Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH) Criteria
Left ventricular strain (associated with inverted T wave in leads V6, I, and/or aVF) 
Supplemental Criteria
Left axis deviation (LAD) for patient’s age
Volume overload (associated with Q wave >5 mm and tall T waves in V5 or V6)
Increased QRS voltage in left leads (with normal QRS duration):
R in lead V6 (and I, aVL, V5), >98th percentile for age
S in lead V1, >98th percentile for age
C.  ECG Findings Secondary to Electrolyte Disturbances, Medications, 
and Systemic Illnesses (Table 7.10)7,9
D. Long QT
	1.	 Diagnosis:
	
a.	 In general, QTc is similar in males and females from birth until late 
adolescence (0.37 to 0.44 second).
	
b.	 In adults, prolonged QTc is generally >0.45 second.
	
c.	 In ∼10% of cases, patients may have a normal QTc. Patients may 
also have a family history of long QT associated with unexplained 
syncope, seizure, or cardiac arrest, without prolongation of QTc on 
ECG.
	
d.	 Treadmill exercise testing may prolong the QTc and will sometimes 
induce arrhythmias.
	2.	 Complications: Associated with ventricular arrhythmias (torsades de 
pointes), syncope, and sudden death.
	3.	 Management:
	
a.	 Congenital long QT: β-­blockers and/or defibrillators; rarely requires 
cardiac sympathetic denervation or cardiac pacemakers.
	
b.	 Acquired long QT: Treatment of arrhythmias, discontinuation of 
precipitating drugs, and correction of metabolic abnormalities. 
E.  Hyperkalemia:
ECG changes dependent on the serum potassium (K+) level; however, the 
ECG may be normal with serum K+ levels between 2.5 and 6 mEq/L.
	1.	 Serum K+ <2.5 mEq/L: Depressed ST segment, biphasic T wave.
	2.	 Serum K+ >6 mEq/L: Tall T wave.

Name/Description
Cause
Treatment
SVT
Sudden run of three or more consecutive premature supraventricular 
beats at >220 beats/min (infant) or >180 beats/min (child), with 
narrow QRS complex and absent/abnormal P wave; either sustained 
(>30 sec) or non-­sustained
Most commonly idiopathic but may be seen in 
congenital heart disease (e.g., Ebstein anomaly, 
transposition)
Vagal maneuvers, adenosine; if unstable, need 
immediate synchronized cardioversion (0.5 J/kg up 
to 1 J/kg); consult cardiologist; refer to the back of 
the book for tachycardia with poor perfusion and 
tachycardia with adequate perfusion algorithms
	I.	 AV Reentrant: Presence of accessory bypass pathway, in conjunction 
with AV node, establishes cyclic pattern of reentry independent of SA 
node; most common cause of non-­sinus tachycardia in children (see 
Wolff-­Parkinson-­White syndrome, Table 7.9)
	II.	 Junctional: Automatic focus; simultaneous depolarization of atria 
and ventricles yields invisible P wave or retrograde P wave
Cardiac surgery, idiopathic
Adjust for clinical situation; consult cardiology
	III.	 Ectopic atrial tachycardia: Rapid firing of ectopic focus in atrium
Idiopathic
AV nodal blockade, ablation
NODAL ESCAPE/JUNCTIONAL RHYTHM
Abnormal rhythm driven by AV node impulse, giving normal QRS complex 
and invisible P wave (buried in preceding QRS or T wave) or retrograde 
P wave (negative in lead II, positive in aVR); seen in sinus bradycardia
Common after surgery of atria
Often requires no treatment; if rate is slow enough, 
may require pacemaker

VENTRICULAR ARRHYTHMIAS
Name/Description
Cause
Treatment
PREMATURE VENTRICULAR CONTRACTION (PVC)
Ectopic ventricular focus causing 
early depolarization. Abnormally 
wide QRS complex appears 
prematurely, usually with full 
compensatory pause. May be 
unifocal or multifocal
Bigeminy: Alternating normal and 
abnormal QRS complexes.
Trigeminy: Two normal QRS com-
plexes followed by an abnormal one
Couplet: Two consecutive PVCs
Myocarditis, myocardial injury, 
cardiomyopathy, long QT, 
congenital and acquired 
heart disease, drugs 
(catecholamines, theophyl-
line, caffeine, anesthetics), 
MVP, anxiety, hypokalemia, 
hypoxia, hypomagnesemia; 
can be normal variant
None; more worrisome if 
associated with underly-
ing heart disease or 
syncope, if worse with 
activity, or if they are 
multiform (especially cou-
plets); address underlying 
cause; rule out structural 
heart disease
VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA
Series of three or more PVCs at rapid 
rate (120–250 beats/min), with 
wide QRS complex and dissociated, 
retrograde, or no P wave
See causes of PVCs (70% have 
underlying cause)
Refer to front of book for 
tachycardia with poor 
perfusion and tachycardia 
with adequate perfusion 
algorithms
VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION
Depolarization of ventricles in unco-
ordinated asynchronous pattern, 
yielding abnormal QRS complexes 
of varying size and morphology 
with irregular, rapid rate; rare in 
children.
Myocarditis, MI, postoperative 
state, digitalis or quinidine 
toxicity, catecholamines, 
severe hypoxia, electrolyte 
disturbances, long QT
Requires immediate defibril-
lation; refer to front of 
book for asystole and

NONVENTRICULAR CONDUCTION DISTURBANCES
Name/Descriptiona
Cause
Treatment
FIRST-­DEGREE HEART BLOCK
Abnormal but asymptomatic 
delay in conduction through AV 
node, yielding prolongation of 
PR interval
Acute rheumatic fever, tick-­borne (e.g., 
Lyme) disease, connective tissue 
disease, congenital heart disease, 
cardiomyopathy, digitalis toxicity, 
postoperative state, normal children
No specific treatment 
except to address 
the underlying 
cause
SECOND-­DEGREE HEART BLOCK: MOBITZ TYPE I (WENCKEBACH)
Progressive lengthening of PR 
interval until a QRS complex is 
not conducted; common finding 
in asymptomatic teenagers
Myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, congenital 
heart disease, postoperative state, MI, 
toxicity (digitalis, β-­blocker), normal 
children, Lyme disease, lupus
Address underlying 
cause, or none 
needed
SECOND-­DEGREE HEART BLOCK: MOBITZ TYPE II
Loss of conduction to ventricle 
without lengthening of the 
PR interval; may progress to 
complete heart block
Same as for Mobitz type I
Address underlying 
cause; may need 
pacemaker
THIRD-­DEGREE (COMPLETE) HEART BLOCK
Complete dissociation of atrial 
and ventricular conduction, 
with atrial rate faster than 
ventricular rate; P wave and 
PP interval regular; RR interval 
regular and much slower
Congenital due to maternal lupus or 
other connective tissue disease
If bradycardic and 
symptomatic, 
consider pacing; 
refer to back of the 
book for bradycardia 
algorithm
aHigh-­degree AV block: Conduction of atrial impulse at regular intervals, yielding 2:1 block (two atrial impulses for each 
ventricular response), 3:1 block, etc.
AV, Atrioventricular; MI, myocardial infarction.

VENTRICULAR CONDUCTION DISTURBANCES
Name/Description
Criteria
Causes/Treatment
RIGHT BUNDLE-­BRANCH BLOCK (RBBB)
Delayed right bundle conduction 
prolongs RV depolarization time, 
leading to wide QRS
	1.	
Prolonged or wide QRS with 
terminal slurred R′ (m-­shaped 
RSR′ or RR′) in V1, V2, aVR
	2.	
Wide and slurred S wave in 
leads I and V6
ASD, surgery with right 
ventriculotomy, 
occasionally seen in 
normal children
LEFT BUNDLE-­BRANCH BLOCK (LBBB)
Delayed left bundle conduction pro-
longs septal and LV depolarization 
time, leading to wide QRS with 
loss of usual septal signal; there 
is still a predominance of left 
ventricle forces; rare in children.
	1.	
Wide negative QRS complex in 
lead V1 with loss of septal R 
wave
	2.	
Wide R or RR′ complex in lead 
V6 with loss of septal Q wave
Hypertension, 
ischemic or valvular 
heart disease, 
cardiomyopathy
WOLFF-­PARKINSON-­WHITE (WPW)
Atrial impulse transmitted via 
anomalous conduction pathway 
to ventricles, bypassing AV 
node and normal ventricular 
conduction system; leads to early 
and prolonged depolarization of 
ventricles; bypass pathway is a 
predisposing condition for SVT
	1.	
Shortened PR interval
	2.	
Delta wave
	3.	
Wide QRS
Acute management of 
SVT if necessary, as 
previously described; 
consider ablation of 
accessory pathway 
if recurrent SVT; 
all patients need 
cardiology referral

Tetralogy of Fallot:
	1.	
Large VSD
	2.	
RVOT obstruction
	3.	
RVH
	4.	
Overriding aorta
Degree of RVOT obstruction will determine whether there is 
clinical cyanosis; if PS is mild, there will be a left-­to-­right 
shunt, and child will be acyanotic; increased obstruction 
leads to increased right-­to-­left shunting across VSD, and 
child will be cyanotic
Loud SEM at LMSB and LUSB and a loud, 
single S2 ± thrill at LMSB and LLSB
Tet spells: Occur in young infants; as 
RVOT obstruction increases or sys-
temic resistance decreases, right-­to-­
left shunting across VSD occurs; may 
present with tachypnea, increasing 
cyanosis, and decreasing murmur
RAD and RVH
Boot-­shaped heart with normal 
heart size ± decreased PVMs
Transposition of great arteries
Nonspecific; extreme cyanosis; loud, 
single S2; no murmur unless there is 
associated VSD or PS
RAD and RVH (due to RV acting as systemic 
ventricle); after 3 days of age, upright T 
wave in V1 may be only abnormality
Classic finding:
“egg on a string” with cardiomeg-
aly; possible increased PVMs.
Tricuspid atresia (absent tricuspid valve and hypoplastic RV 
and PA; must have ASD, PDA, or VSD to survive)
Single S2 + grade 2–3/6 systolic 
regurgitation murmur at LLSB if VSD 
is present. Occasional PDA murmur.
Superior QRS axis; RAE or CAE and LVH.
Normal or slightly enlarged 
heart size; may have boot-­

10 minutes, and the ABG is repeated. In cardiac disease, there will not be 
a significant change in Pao2 following the oxygen challenge test. A Pao2 of 
>200 after exposure to Fio2 of 1.0 is considered normal, and >150 indi-
cates pulmonary rather than cardiac disease. Note: Pulse oximetry is not 
useful for following changes in oxygenation once saturation has reached 
100% (approximately a Pao2 of >90 mmHg).12–17 See Table  EC 7.A for 
interpretation of oxygen challenge test (hyperoxia test). 
IV.  ACQUIRED HEART DISEASE
A.  Myocardial Infarction (MI) in Children (Box 7.4; Fig. 7.8)
B.  Endocarditis
	1.	 Common causative organisms: Approximately 70% of endocardi-
tis is caused by streptococcal species (Streptococcus viridans, 
enterococci), 20% by staphylococcal species (Staphylococcus 
aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis), and 10% by other organisms 
(Haemophilus influenzae, gram-­negative bacteria, fungi).
	2.	 Presentation: Heart murmur, recurrent fever, splenomegaly, petechiae, 
fatigue, Osler nodes (tender nodules at the fingertips), Janeway lesions 
(painless hemorrhagic areas on the palms or soles), splinter hemor-
rhages, Roth spots (retinal hemorrhages).
	3.	 Diagnosis—Duke’s Criteria:
	
a.	 Pathologic criteria:
	
(1)	 Direct evidence of endocarditis based upon histologic findings.
	
(2)	 Gram stain positive or cultures of specimens.
	
b.	 Clinical criteria: 1 major criterion and 1 minor OR 3 minor criteria:
	
(1)	 Major: Persistently positive blood cultures (2 sets 1 hour apart), 
positive echocardiogram for vegetations, new regurgitant mur-
mur, single positive blood culture for Coxiella burnetii.
	
(2)	 Minor: Fever, predisposing valvular condition (prosthetic heart 
valve, valve lesion OR intravenous drug user [IVDU]), vascular 
phenomenon (e.g., emboli), immunologic phenomenon (e.g., 
Roth’s spots, Osler’s nodes), positive blood cultures that do not 
meet major criteria.
	4.	 Management: Daily blood cultures while febrile; support heart failure 
symptoms with diuretics, digoxin, etc. 
C.  Bacterial Endocarditis Prophylaxis
See Box 7.5 for cardiac conditions that meet criteria for prophylaxis.18
	1.	 All dental procedures that involve treatment of gingival tissue, the peri-
apical region of the teeth, or oral mucosal perforation.
	2.	 Invasive procedures that involve incision or biopsy of respiratory 
mucosa, such as tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.
	3.	 Not recommended for genitourinary or gastrointestinal tract procedures; 
solely for bacterial endocarditis prevention.
	4.	 Treatment: Amoxicillin is preferred PO; ampicillin if unable to take PO; 
cephalexin if allergic to penicillins.28

CARDIAC CONDITIONS FOR WHICH ANTIBIOTIC PROPHYLAXIS IS 
RECOMMENDED
 • 
Prosthetic cardiac valve
 • 
Previous bacterial endocarditis
 • 
Congenital heart disease (CHD)—Limited to the following conditions:
 
• 
Unrepaired cyanotic defect, including palliative shunts and conduits
 
• 
Completely repaired CHD with prosthetic material/device (placed by 
surgery or catheterization), during first 6 months after procedure
 
• 
Repaired CHD with residual defects at or adjacent to the site of prosthetic 
patch or device (which inhibits endothelialization)
 
• 
Cardiac transplantation patients who develop cardiac valvulopathy
Data from Wilson W, Taubert KA, Gewitz M, et al. Prevention of infective endocarditis: Guidelines 
from the American Heart Association: A guideline from the American Heart Association Rheumatic 
Fever, Endocarditis, and Kawasaki Disease Committee, Council on Cardiovascular Disease in the 
Young, and the Council on Clinical Cardiology, Council on Cardiovascular Surgery and Anesthesia, 
and the Quality of Care and Outcomes Research Interdisciplinary Working Group. Circulation. 
2007;116(15):1736–1754.
	2.	 Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM): Abnormality of 
myocardial cells leading to significant ventricular hypertrophy (usually 
left ventricle) with small to normal ventricular dimensions. Increased 
contractile function, impaired filling secondary to stiff ventricles. Most 
common type is asymmetrical septal hypertrophy with (HOCM) or with-
out left ventricular outflow obstruction. There is a 4% to 6% incidence 
of sudden death in children and adolescents.
	
a.	 Treatment: Moderate restriction of physical activity, negative inotro-
pes (β-­blocker, calcium channel blocker) to help improve filling, and 
maintenance of adequate hydration. If at increased risk for sudden 
death, may consider implantable defibrillator. If symptomatic with 
subaortic obstruction, may benefit from myectomy.
	
b.	 Additional management: HOCM is a preload dependent lesion and, 
therefore, patient may benefit from higher rates of fluid administra-
tion. Avoid inotropes, tachycardia, and afterload reduction.
	3.	 Restrictive cardiomyopathy: Myocardial or endocardial disease (usually 
infiltrative or fibrotic) resulting in stiff ventricular walls with restric-
tion of diastolic filling but normal contractile function. Results in atrial 
enlargement. Associated with a high mortality rate. Very rare in children. 
Treatment is supportive with diuretics, anticoagulants, calcium channel 
blockers, a pacemaker for heart block, and cardiac transplantation, if 
severe.
	4.	 Myocarditis: Inflammation of myocardial tissue
	
a.	 Etiology:
	
(1)	 Infectious: viral (coxsackie virus, echovirus, adenovirus), bacte-
rial, rickettsial, fungal, parasitic
	
(2)	 Other: immune-­mediated disease (Kawasaki disease, acute 
rheumatic fever), collagen vascular disease, toxin-­induced

b.	 Presentation: Symptoms can be nonspecific, including fatigue, short-
ness of breath, emesis. Exam includes signs of CHF, soft systolic 
murmur, arrhythmia.
	
c.	 Testing:
	
(1)	 Imaging: ECG: Low QRS voltages throughout (<5 mm), ST-­
segment and T-­wave changes (e.g., decreased T-­wave ampli-
tude), prolongation of QT interval, arrhythmias (especially 
premature contractions, first-­ or second-­degree AV block); echo 
shows enlarged chambers and impaired LV function
	
(2)	 Labs: CK, troponin
	
d.	 Treatment: Bed rest, diuretics, inotropes (dopamine, dobutamine, 
milrinone), digoxin, gamma globulin, ACE inhibitors, possibly 
steroids.
	
e.	 May require ventricular assist device and/or heart transplantation 
(≈20% to 25% of cases). 
E.  Pericardial Disease
	1.	 Pericarditis: Inflammation of visceral and parietal layers of pericardium. 
It is often self-­limited.
	
a.	 Presentation: Chest pain (often pleuritic in nature), fever, tachycar-
dia, distant heart sounds, friction rub.
	
b.	 EKG: Diffuse ST-­segment elevation in almost all leads (representing 
inflammation of adjacent myocardium); PR-­segment depression.
	
c.	 Treatment: Address underlying condition and provide symptomatic 
treatment with rest, analgesia, and anti-­inflammatory drugs.
	2.	 Pericardial effusion: Accumulation of excess fluid in pericardial sac.
	
a.	 Etiology: Acute pericarditis, serous effusion from increased hydro-
static pressure (CHF), decreased plasma oncotic pressure, increased 
capillary permeability.
	
b.	 Presentation: Can be asymptomatic, chest or abdominal pain, 
muffled heart sounds, dullness to percussion, vital sign instability 
from cardiac compression (e.g., hypotension).
	
c.	 EKG: Decreased QRS voltage, electrical alternans.
	
d.	 Treatment: Address underlying condition. Observe if asymptom-
atic; use pericardiocentesis if there is sudden increase in volume 
or hemodynamic compromise. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs) or steroids may be of benefit, depending on 
etiology.
	3.	 Cardiac tamponade: Accumulation of pericardial fluid under high pres-
sure causing compression of cardiac chambers, limiting filling, and 
decreasing stroke volume and cardiac output.
	
a.	 Etiology: Same as pericardial effusion.
	
b.	 Presentation: Dyspnea, fatigue, signs of CHF (jugular venous disten-
sion, hepatomegaly, edema, tachypnea/rales), pulsus paradoxus.
	
c.	 EKG: Same as pericardial effusion.
	
d.	 Echocardiogram: RV collapse in early diastole, RA/LA collapse in end 
diastole and early systole.
 

--- Page 224 ---
180    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	
e.	 Treatment is pericardiocentesis with temporary catheter left in place 
if necessary; pericardial window or stripping, if it is a recurrent 
condition. 
F.  Kawasaki Disease19
Acute febrile vasculitis of unknown etiology, which is common in children 
aged <8 years and is the leading cause of acquired childhood heart dis-
ease in developed countries.
	1.	 Etiology: Unknown; thought to be immune regulated in response to 
infectious agents or environmental toxins.
	2.	 Diagnosis:
	
a.	 Typical Kawasaki disease: Based on clinical criteria. These include 
high fever lasting 5 days or more, plus at least four of the following 
five criteria:
	
(1)	 Bilateral, painless, bulbar conjunctival injection without exudate
	
(2)	 Erythematous mouth and pharynx, strawberry tongue, or red 
cracked lips
	
(3)	 Polymorphous exanthem (may be morbilliform, maculopapular, 
or scarlatiniform)
	
(4)	 Swelling of hands and feet with erythema of palms and soles
	
(5)	 Cervical lymphadenopathy (>1.5 cm in diameter), usually single 
and unilateral
	
b.	 Atypical/incomplete Kawasaki disease: A suspicion of Kawasaki 
disease but with fewer of the criteria required for diagnosis. Even 
without all criteria, there is a risk for coronary artery abnormalities.
	
(1)	 More often seen in infants. Echocardiography should be con-
sidered in any infant <6 months with fever >7 days duration, 
laboratory evidence of systemic inflammation (CRP >3 and/or 
ESR >40), and no other explanation for the febrile illness.
	
(2)	 See Fig. 7.9 for evaluation of incomplete Kawasaki disease.
	
(3)	 Supplemental laboratory criteria: Albumin ≤3.0 g/dL, anemia 
for age, elevation of alanine aminotransferase, platelets after 7 
days ≥450,000/mm3, white blood cell count ≥15,000/mm3,  
and urine white blood cells/hpf ≥10 (non-­catheterized 
specimen).
	3.	 Other clinical findings: Often associated with extreme irritability, abdomi-
nal pain, diarrhea, vomiting. Also seen are arthritis and arthralgia, 
hepatic enlargement, jaundice, acute acalculous distention of the 
gallbladder, carditis.
	4.	 Laboratory findings: Leukocytosis with left shift, neutrophils with vacu-
oles or toxic granules, elevated C-­reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate (ESR) (seen acutely), thrombocytosis, normocytic 
and normochromic anemia, sterile pyuria (33%), increased transami-
nases (40%), hyperbilirubinemia (10%).
	5.	 Subacute phase (11 to 25 days after onset of illness): Resolution 
of fever, rash, and lymphadenopathy. Often, desquamation of 
the fingertips or toes and thrombocytosis occur. Cardiovascular

complications: If untreated, 20% to 25% develop coronary artery 
aneurysms and dilation in subacute phase (peak prevalence occurs 
about 2 to 4 weeks after onset of disease; rarely appears after 6 
weeks) and are at risk for coronary thrombosis acutely and coronary 
stenosis chronically. Carditis; aortic, mitral, and tricuspid regurgita-
tion; pericardial effusion; CHF; MI; left ventricular dysfunction; and 
ECG changes may also occur.
	6.	 Convalescent phase: ESR, CRP, and platelet count return to normal. 
Those with coronary artery abnormalities are at increased risk for MI, 
arrhythmias, and sudden death.
	7.	 Management (see also Table EC 7.B)19
 

--- Page 226 ---
182    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	
a.	 Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)
	
(1)	 Shown to reduce incidence of coronary artery dilation to <3% 
and decrease duration of fever, if given in the first 10 days of 
illness. Current recommended regimen is a single dose of IVIG, 
2 g/kg over 10 to 12 hours.19
	
(2)	 Can be given to children after 10th day of fever if ESR or CRP 
elevated with persistent fever.
	
(3)	 Approximately 10% of patients treated with IVIG fail to respond 
(persistent or recurrent fever ≥36 hours after IVIG completion). 
Retreat with second dose.19
	
b.	 Aspirin is recommended for both its anti-­inflammatory and antiplate-
let effects. In the United States, high-­dose aspirin (80 to 100 mg/
kg/day divided in four doses) is recommended 48 to 72 hours after 
defervescence. This is given with IVIG. Low-­dose aspirin (3 to 5 mg/
kg/day as a single daily dose) is continued for 6 to 8 weeks or until 
platelet count and ESR are normal (if there are no coronary artery 
abnormalities). Aspirin may be continued indefinitely, if coronary 
artery abnormalities persist.19
	
c.	 Dipyridamole is sometimes used as an alternative to aspirin, particu-
larly if symptoms of influenza or varicella arise while on aspirin (due 
to concern for Reye syndrome).
	
d.	 Follow-­up: Serial echocardiography is recommended to assess coronary 
arteries and left ventricular function (at time of diagnosis, at 2 weeks, 
at 6 to 8 weeks, and at 12 months [optional]). More frequent intervals 
and long-­term follow-­up are recommended if abnormalities are seen on 
echocardiography. Cardiac catheterization may be necessary.
	
e.	 Follow up with Cardiology depending on presence of coronary aneu-
rysms and Z score of aneurysm (see Table EC 7.B). 
G.  Rheumatic Heart Disease
	1.	 Etiology: Believed to be an immunologically-mediated, delayed sequela 
of group A streptococcal pharyngitis.
	2.	 Clinical findings: History of streptococcal pharyngitis 1 to 5 weeks 
before onset of symptoms. Often with pallor, malaise, easy fatigability.
	3.	 Diagnosis: Jones criteria (Box 7.6).
	4.	 Management: Penicillin, bed rest, salicylates, supportive management of 
CHF (if present) with diuretics, digoxin, morphine.

B.  Goals for Lipid Levels in Childhood23
	1.	 Total cholesterol
	
a.	 Acceptable (<170 mg/dL): Repeat measurement in 3 to 5 years.
	
b.	 Borderline (170 to 199 mg/dL): Repeat cholesterol and average with 
previous measurement. If <170 mg/dL, repeat in 3 to 5 years. If ≥ 
170 mg/dL, obtain lipoprotein analysis.
	
c.	 High (≥200 mg/dL): Obtain lipoprotein analysis.
	2.	 Low-­density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol
	
a.	 Acceptable (<110 mg/dL)
	
b.	 Borderline (110 to 129 mg/dL)
	
c.	 High (≥130 mg/dL) 
X.  CARDIOVASCULAR SCREENING
A.  Sports24
There is no established or mandated pre-­participation sports screening. 
There is a recommended history and physical examination screening from 
the AHA.24 Routine ECGs are not required unless there is suspicion of 
underlying cardiac disease Box EC 7.A).
 B.  Attention–Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)27
	1.	 Obtain a good patient and family history as well as physical examination.
	2.	 There is no increased risk of sudden cardiac death in children without 
cardiac disease taking ADHD medications. There is no consensus on 
universal ECG screening. ECGs should be obtained in those who screen 
with positive answers on history, in cases of polypharmacy, in those 
with tachycardia while on medications, and in those with a history of 
significant cardiac disease. If a patient has significant heart disease 
or concern for cardiac disease, have patient evaluated by a pediatric 
cardiologist.

II.  VASCULAR ANOMALIES1
A.  Vascular Tumors
	1.	 Infantile hemangiomas (Fig. 8.1, Color Plates).2,3
	
a.	 Pathogenesis: Benign vascular tumor with rapid proliferation followed 
by spontaneous involution. Most present before 4 weeks of age. 
Undergo rapid growth between 1 and 2 months of age, with 80% of 
size reached by 3 months. Most begin to regress between 6 and 12 
months of age, with the majority of tumor regression occurring by 4 
years of age. 50% to 70% resolve completely.
	
b.	 Clinical presentation: Newborns may demonstrate pale macules with 
threadlike telangiectasias that later develop into hemangiomas. May 
be superficial, deep, or mixed. After involution, can have residual 
skin changes including scarring and atrophy.
	
c.	 Indicators that should prompt consideration for early treatment:
(1) Potential for life-­threatening complications: Airway hemangiomas, 
liver hemangiomas (associated with high-­output heart failure and 
severe hypothyroidism), and profuse bleeding from an ulcerated 
hemangioma.
(2) Risk of functional impairment: Interference with the develop-
ment of vision (if near eye) and interference with feeding (if near 
mouth).
(3) Ulceration: Most common complication (5% to 21%). Can 
be extremely painful and usually scars; risk greatest in large 
hemangiomas and those located in skin creases, particularly the 
diaper area.
(4) Associated structural anomalies: PHACES syndrome 
(Posterior cranial fossa malformations, large segmental facial 
Hemangiomas, Arterial lesions, Cardiovascular anomalies (aortic 
anomalies), Eye anomalies, Sternal cleft anomalies/supraumbili-
cal raphes4) and LUMBAR syndrome (Lower body hemangioma, 
Urogenital anomalies, Ulceration, Myelopathy, Bony deformities, 
Anorectal malformations, Arterial anomalies, Renal anomalies).
(5) Potential for disfigurement: Risk of permanent scarring or distor-
tion of anatomic landmarks.

d.	 Diagnosis: Usually diagnosed clinically. Atypical clinical findings, 
growth pattern, and equivocal imaging should prompt tissue biopsy 
to exclude other neoplasms or unusual vascular malformations. See 
Table 8.1 for indications to order imaging.
	
e.	 Treatment:
(1) Most are uncomplicated and can be observed with watchful 
waiting. Photo documentation is used to follow the growth and 
regression process.
	(2)	If an infantile hemangioma is identified as high risk, the child 
should be evaluated by a hemangioma specialist promptly, as 
there is a narrow window of opportunity in which to intervene 
and prevent poor outcomes.
	(3)	β-­adrenergic blockers such as propranolol are considered first-­line 
therapy for complicated infantile hemangiomas and should be 
initiated under supervision of a pediatric dermatologist or experi-
enced practitioner.5 While patients should be clinically screened 
for cardiac disease, EKG and/or echocardiogram are not required 
unless there is clinical concern. Contraindications include: 
Reactive airways, sinus bradycardia, decompensated heart failure, 
greater than 1st degree heart block, hypotension, hypoglycemia, 
hypersensitivity to propranolol. Off label use of selective beta-­
blockers may be considered in certain patients. Duration should 
be at least 6 months and up to 12 months of age.6
	(4)	Corticosteroids are considered second line. Similar efficacy to 
propranolol in a prospective, randomized, investigator-­blinded 
trial, but propranolol is better tolerated and with fewer severe 
side effects.7
	(5)	Topical timolol is effective in superficial, uncomplicated heman-
giomas (recommend 0.5% gel forming solution).
TABLE 8.1
INDICATIONS TO OBTAIN IMAGING OF INFANTILE HEMANGIOMAS

192    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	2.	 Pyogenic granuloma (Lobular Capillary Hemangioma) (Fig. 8.2, Color 
Plates)
	
a.	 Clinical presentation: Benign vascular tumor, appears as small (usu-
ally 3 to 10 mm but occasionally much larger) bright red papule that 
grows over several weeks to months into sessile or pedunculated 
papule with a “collarette,” scale, or crust. Can bleed profusely with 
minor trauma and can ulcerate. Rarely spontaneously regresses. 
Seen in all ages; average age of diagnosis 6 months to 10 years. 
Located on head and neck, sometimes in oral mucosa but can be at 
any skin site and often misdiagnosed as hemangiomas.
	
b.	 Treatment: Usually required, given frequent bleeding and ulceration. 
Options include shave excision or curettage with cautery of base, 
surgical excision, carbon dioxide laser excision, or pulsed dye laser 
therapy. For most cases, shave and cautery are quick, safe, low risk, 
and can be performed quickly with local anesthesia. 
B.  Vascular Malformations
Include capillary (port-­wine stains and salmon patch/stork bite/angel kiss), 
lymphatic, venous, and arteriovenous malformations.
Note: For a comparison of vascular malformations to vascular tumors, 
please see Table EC 8.A.8 
III.  INFECTIONS
A.  Viral
	1.	 Warts
	
a.	 Pathogenesis: Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) of the epithelium or 
mucus membrane.
	
b.	 Clinical presentation:
(1) Common warts: Skin-­colored, rough, minimally scaly papules 
and nodules found most commonly on the hands, although 
can occur anywhere. Can be solitary or multiple, range from a 
few millimeters to several centimeters, may form large plaques 
or a confluent linear pattern secondary to autoinoculation. 
Sometimes persistent in immunocompromised patients.
(2) Flat warts: Flesh to brown/yellow-­colored, smooth, flat-­topped 
papules commonly found over the hands, arms, and face. 
Usually <2 mm in diameter and often present in clusters.
(3) Plantar warts: Occur on soles of feet as inward growing, 
hyperkeratotic plaques and papules. Trauma on weight-­bearing 
surfaces results in small black dots (petechiae from thrombosed 
vessels on the surface of the wart). Can be painful.
	
c.	 Diagnosis: Clinical diagnosis.
	
d.	 Treatment9:
	(1)	Spontaneous resolution occurs in greater than 75% of warts in 
otherwise healthy individuals within 3 years. No specific treatment 
clearly better than placebo, except possibly topical salicylic acid.

(2) Keratolytics (topical salicylates): Particularly effective in combi-
nation with adhesive tape occlusion. Response may take 4 to 6 
months.
(3) Destructive techniques, candida antigen, cantharidin, or “beetle 
juice” are not clearly more effective than placebo. Additionally, 
destructive techniques can be painful and cause scarring. These 
options are not recommended in children.
	2.	 Molluscum contagiosum (Fig. 8.3, Color Plates)
	
a.	 Pathogenesis: Large DNA poxvirus. Spread by skin-­to-­skin contact.
	
b.	 Clinical presentation: Dome-­shaped, often umbilicated, trans-
lucent to white papules that range from 1 mm to 1 cm. Occur 
anywhere except palms and soles, most commonly on the trunk 
and intertriginous areas. Can occur in the genital area and lower 
abdomen when obtained as a sexually transmitted infection. 
May be pruritic and can be surrounded by erythema, resembling 
eczema.
	
c.	 Diagnosis: Clinical diagnosis.
	
d.	 Treatment: Most spontaneously resolve within 6 to 18 months and do 
not require intervention other than monitoring for secondary bacterial 
infection. Surrounding eczematous changes may indicate an immu-
nologic reaction and serve as a harbinger of regression. Treatment 
may cause scarring and may not be more effective than placebo. 
Recurrences are common.
	3.	 Herpes simplex virus
	
a.	 Pathogenesis: Either HSV-­1 or HSV-­2 may be implicated, regardless 
of lesion location. During the initial outbreak, oral lesions last 2 to 
3 weeks whereas genital lesions may last 2 to 6 weeks. Recurrent 
episodes are usually much shorter.
	
b.	 Clinical presentation (Fig. 8.6, Color Plate): Symptoms include 
prodrome of tingling, itching, or burning followed by painful vesicles 
on erythematous base that may last 7 to 10 days, break open, and 
crust prior to healing, flu-­like symptoms, dehydration (gingivostoma-
titis), dysuria (genital), ophthalmologic symptoms (keratitis). May be 
triggered by stress, illness, sun exposure, and menstruation. The first 
outbreak is typically the worst.
	
c.	 Diagnosis: Diagnosed clinically and, in many centers, with viral DNA 
PCR (more sensitive than culture). To culture a lesion, clean with 
alcohol, un-­roof lesion with sterile needle or wooden side of cotton 
swab, collect vesicular fluid on sterile swab, and send in viral trans-
port medium.
	
d.	 Treatment: Acyclovir or valacyclovir for 7 to 14 days (see Formulary 
for dosing). For children with herpetic gingivostomatitis, antiviral 
therapy should be initiated within 72 to 96 hours of onset if they 
are unable to drink or have significant pain. Valacyclovir is generally 
preferred as it is more bioavailable than acyclovir and, as a result, is 
dosed less frequently.

194    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	4.	 Erythema infectiosum (“fifth disease”)
	
a.	 Pathogenesis: Parvovirus B19.
	
b.	 Clinical presentation: Pediatric presentation of nonspecific febrile 
illness with headache, coryza, and gastrointestinal complaints. Two 
to five days after onset of symptoms, the classic malar rash with 
“slapped cheek” appearance erupts, followed by a reticular rash to 
the trunk several days later. Associated signs and symptoms include 
arthralgias (more common in adults) and a transient aplastic crisis, 
which may be more of a problem in patients with hemoglobinopa-
thies and pregnant women.
	
c.	 Diagnosis: Clinical diagnosis, serum IgM, or serum DNA PCR.
	
d.	 Treatment: Supportive care and avoiding contact with pregnant 
women.
	5.	 Pityriasis rosea
	
a.	 Pathogenesis: Viral etiology (possibly HHV-6, HHV-7) has been 
hypothesized but no definitive cause has been described.
	
b.	 Clinical presentation: Typically asymptomatic or may have mild pru-
ritus. Classic presentation with a round to oval, sharply demarcated, 
scaly, salmon-­colored herald patch with central clearing on trunk 
followed by a “Christmas tree” distribution of oval crops of lesions 
similar to herald patch. Pediatric patients may have an atypical distri-
bution involving the scalp, face, distal extremities, and sparing of the 
trunk. Lesions typically resolve in 4 to 6 weeks.
	
c.	 Diagnosis: Clinical diagnosis.
	
d.	 Treatment: Typically self-­resolving.
	6.	 Roseola infantum (Fig. 8.5, Color Plates)
	
a.	 Pathogenesis: Human Herpesvirus 6 (HHV-­6).
	
b.	 Clinical presentation: Typically diagnosed in children <2 years old 
with peak 7 to 13 months. Febrile phase of 3 to 5 days of high fever 
(often >40°C), viremia, and irritability. As febrile phase resolves, 
patients develop a morbilliform rash on neck and trunk that spreads 
centripetally to face and extremities for 1 to 2 days.
	
c.	 Diagnosis: Clinical diagnosis.
	
d.	 Treatment: Self-­resolving.
	7.	 Hand, foot, and mouth disease
	
a.	 Pathogenesis: Most commonly Coxsackievirus A serotypes.
	
b.	 Clinical presentation: Oral lesions on the tongue, buccal mucosa, and 
palate that initially are 1 to 5 mm erythematous macules and evolve 
to vesicles and ulcers with a thin erythematous halo. Erythematous, 
non-­pruritic 1 to 10 mm macules, papules, and/or vesicles on the 
palms and soles. Typically resolve in 3 to 4 days. Usually non-
tender, unless caused by Coxsackie A6 (associated with high fevers, 
widespread lesions, longer duration [12 days], palmar and plantar 
desquamation, and nail dystrophy).
	
c.	 Diagnosis: Clinical diagnosis.
	
d.	 Treatment: Supportive care.

	8.	 Reactive erythema (Fig. 8.4; Figs. 8.5–8.10, Color Plates)
	
a.	 Pathogenesis: Represent cutaneous reaction patterns triggered by 
endogenous and environmental factors (e.g., viral infections, drug 
reactions).
	
b.	 Clinical presentation: Group of disorders characterized by erythema-
tous patches, plaques, and nodules that vary in size, shape, and 
distribution. 
B.  Parasitic
	1.	 Scabies (Fig. 8.11, Color Plates)
	
a.	 Pathogenesis: Caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. Spread by skin-­
to-­skin contact and through fomites. Can live for 2 days away from a 
human host. Female mites burrow and lay eggs under the skin.
	
b.	 Clinical presentation: Initial lesion is a small, erythematous papule 
that is easy to overlook. Can have burrows (elongated, edematous 
papulovesicles, often with a pustule at the advancing border) which 
are pathognomonic. Most commonly located in interdigital webs, 
wrist folds, elbows, axilla, genitals, buttocks, and belt line. In temper-
ate climates, the face and scalp are usually spared. In young infants, 
the palms and soles are also commonly involved. Burrows are 
most dramatic in patients who are unable to scratch (e.g., infants). 
Disseminated eczematous eruption results in generalized severe 
pruritus, especially at night. Can become nodular, particularly in 
intertriginous areas, or be susceptible to superinfection due to fre-
quent excoriations. Immunosuppressed patients may develop diffuse 
scaly crusted eruption and lack pruritus.
	
c.	 Treatment10:
(1) Permethrin cream: 5% cream applied to skin from neck down in 
normal hosts including under fingernails and toenails. Rinse off 
after 8 to 14 hours. Can repeat in 7 to 10 days.
(2) Ivermectin (off-­label use): Single dose; can repeat in 2 weeks. 
Efficacy comparable to permethrin cream. May be the best 
choice for immunodeficient patients where total body application 
may be difficult.
(3) Environment: Mites cannot live away from human skin for more 
than 2 to 3 days. Launder clothing and sheets. Bag and seal 
stuffed animals and pillows for 2 to 3 days. Consider treatment 
of close contacts. 
C.  Fungal (Figs. 8.12–8.16, Color Plates)
	1.	 Tinea capitis (see Fig. 8.12, Color Plates)
	
a.	 Pathogenesis: Mostly caused by fungi of the genus Trichophyton in 
North America (95%), less commonly Microsporum (5% or less), 
and spread through contact and fomites.
	
b.	 Epidemiology: Usually occurs in young children, with higher inci-
dence in African American children, but any age and ethnicity can 
be affected.

c.	 Clinical presentation:
(1) Black dot: Most common. Slowly growing, erythematous, scaling 
patches. These areas develop alopecia and black dots are vis-
ible on scalp where hair has broken.
(2) Gray patch (“seborrheic dermatitis type”): Erythematous, 
scaling, well-­demarcated patches that grow centrifugally. Hair 
breaks off a few millimeters above the scalp and takes on a gray/
frosted appearance.
(3) Kerion (see Fig. 8.13, Color Plates): Complication of tinea capitis 
or tinea corporis. Type IV hypersensitivity to fungus. Raised, 
boggy/spongy lesions, often tender and covered with purulent 
exudate. Most commonly occurs months after primary infection.
	(4)	All can be associated with posterior cervical lymphadenopathy.
	
d.	 Diagnosis: Can be made clinically, but since oral antifungal therapy is 
indicated, tinea capitis should be confirmed by direct microscopic exam 
of a potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation of the proximal ends of 
hairs, gently and painlessly scraped from the affected area. Cultures 
may be obtained by using a sterile toothbrush or cotton swab. The scale 
can be scraped directly into a sterile plastic cup and/or the cotton swab 
tips can be broken off and placed into the sterile plastic cups.
	
e.	 Treatment11: Always requires systemic therapy. First-­line therapy 
includes oral griseofulvin for 10 to 12 weeks (which should be taken 
with fatty foods for improved absorption) and terbinafine for 6 weeks 
(see Formulary for dosing). Most experts consider terbinafine supe-
rior to griseofulvin for T. tonsurans because of its shorter duration of 
therapy and superior effectiveness. The FDA recommends baseline 
and follow-­up hepatic function testing in children taking terbinafine, 
though most clinicians forego laboratory testing in healthy children 
without history of liver disease if treatment is 6 weeks or less. Though 
not FDA-­approved for tinea capitis, fluconazole at 6 mg/kg/day (max 
400 mg/day) for 6 weeks is recommended by the AAP Red Book as 
an alternative treatment of tinea capitis in children younger than 2 
years old.12 All family members, particularly other children, should 
be examined carefully for subtle infection. Selenium sulfide 2.5% 
shampoo may shorten the period of shedding of fungal organisms 
and reduce risk of infection of unaffected family members.
	2.	 Tinea corporis and pedis11 (see Figs. 8.14 and 8.15, Color Plates)
	
a.	 Pathogenesis: Spread through direct contact and fomites, especially 
in sports with close contact.
	
b.	 Clinical presentation: Pruritic, erythematous, annular patch or plaque 
with central clearing and a scaly raised border. Typically affects 
glabrous skin (smooth and bare).
	
c.	 Diagnosis: Usually diagnosed clinically, but a KOH preparation or 
fungal culture can be used to help guide diagnosis.
	
d.	 Treatment: Topical antifungals (terbinafine, azole) through 1 to 2 
weeks past lesion resolution. Widespread eruption may require oral 
antifungals.
 

--- Page 249 ---
198    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	3.	 Tinea versicolor (see Fig. 8.16, Color Plates)
	
a.	 Pathogenesis: Caused by Malassezia. Exacerbated by hot/humid 
weather, hyperhidrosis, topical skin oil use. Most people are colo-
nized with Malassezia but only a small number are prone to develop 
clinical lesions. Not associated with poor hygiene. Not contagious.
	
b.	 Clinical presentation: Well demarcated, minimally scaly, hypopig-
mented macules or patches. Hypopigmented areas tend to be more 
prominent in the summer because affected areas do not tan. Lesions 
often have a fine scale that may be noted following gentle rubbing 
and can be mildly pruritic but are usually asymptomatic.
	
c.	 Diagnosis: KOH microscopy reveals pseudohyphae and yeast cells 
that appear like “spaghetti and meatballs.”
	
d.	 Treatment: Topical antifungal shampoos and/or creams (miconazole, 
oxiconazole, ketoconazole) or selenium sulfide are effective. Given the 
risk of hepatotoxicity, oral azole antifungals are reserved for resistant 
or widespread disease. Oral terbinafine is not effective. Pigmentation 
changes may take months to resolve despite successful treatment. 
D.  Bacterial
	1.	 Impetigo
	
a.	 Pathogenesis: Contagious bacterial infection of the skin, most com-
monly caused by Staphylococcus aureus (99% MSSA), with a minor-
ity of cases caused by Group A Streptococcus.
	
b.	 Clinical presentation:
(1) Nonbullous impetigo: Papules that evolve into erythematous 
pustules or vesicles that break and form thick, honey-­colored 
crusts and plaques. Commonly overlying any break to skin bar-
rier. Primarily face and extremities.
(2) Bullous impetigo: Painless vesicles that evolve into flaccid bullae 
and crusted patches with undermined border. Seen more in 
infants and young children. Caused by Staphylococcus aureus 
exfoliative toxin A.
	
c.	 Diagnosis: Clinical diagnosis.
	
d.	 Treatment: When impetigo is contained to a small area, topical mupi-
rocin may be used for 5 days. When the infection is widespread, 
an oral antibiotic such as cephalexin should be used for 7 days. 
Consider broader coverage if MRSA is suspected, although MSSA 
accounts for most infections.
	2.	 Staph scalded skin syndrome
	
a.	 Pathogenesis: Staphylococcus aureus infections of the skin with hema-
togenous dissemination of exfoliative toxin A or B to the epidermis.
	
b.	 Clinical presentation: Typical presentation is Ritter disease (general-
ized exfoliation) in a 3-­ to 7-­day-­old infant who initially is febrile and 
irritable with conjunctivitis and perioral erythema. In addition to 
newborns, this presentation is seen in young children who do not 
have antibodies to the toxin and often do not clear the toxin-­antibody 
complex quickly due to decreased renal excretion. One to two days 
after the prodromal onset, patient develops diffuse erythema, fragile,

flaccid bullae and erosions that are Nikolsky positive in areas of 
mechanical stress such as intertriginous areas. Lesions are not 
scarring as they are intraepidermal. Older children tend to have a 
localized bullous impetigo with tender scarlatiniform eruption. Infants 
and toddlers usually have a combination of the presentations seen in 
neonates and older children along with white to brown thick flaking 
desquamation of the entire body, especially the face and neck.
	
c.	 Diagnosis: Typically clinically. However, cultures should be obtained 
from any potential source site of infection or colonization such as the 
medial canthi or nares.
	
d.	 Treatment: Nearly all cases are MSSA, with an increasing number 
being clindamycin resistant. First-­line treatment may include oral 
penicillinase-­resistant beta-­lactams such as first or second-­generation 
cephalosporins. Vancomycin should be considered in patients who 
fail to respond to treatment and/or in areas with a high prevalence of 
MRSA. Management should also include supportive care with topical 
emollients and close monitoring of fluid and electrolyte status.
	3.	 Scarlet fever (Fig. 8.17, Color Plates)
	
a.	 Pathogenesis: Exotoxin-­mediated response to a Streptococcus pyo-
genes infection, typically pharyngitis.
	
b.	 Clinical presentation: Sandpaper-­like, coarse, erythematous, blanch-
ing rash that originates in the groin and axilla then spreads to the 
trunk then extremities but spares the palms and soles. May have 
Pastia lines. Associated with pharyngitis, circumoral pallor, and a 
strawberry tongue.
	
c.	 Diagnosis: Clinical diagnosis. May benefit from rapid strep test and 
throat culture.
	
d.	 Treatment: No additional treatment aside from treating the patient’s 
Strep pharyngitis.
	4.	 Cellulitis: See Chapter 17. 
IV.  HAIR LOSS (FIGS. 8.18–8.20, COLOR PLATES)
A.  Telogen Effluvium (see Fig. 8.18, Color Plates)
	1.	 Pathogenesis: Most common cause of diffuse hair loss. Mature hair 
follicles switch prematurely to the telogen (resting) state, with shedding 
within 3 months.
	2.	 Clinical presentation: Diffuse hair thinning 3 months after a stress-
ful event (major illnesses or surgery, pregnancy, severe weight 
loss).
	3.	 Treatment: Self-­limited. Regrowth usually occurs over several months. 
B.  Alopecia Areata (see Fig. 8.19, Color Plates)
	1.	 Clinical presentation: Chronic inflammatory (probably autoimmune) 
disease that starts with well-­circumscribed small bald patches and 
normal-­appearing underlying skin. New lesions may demonstrate subtle 
erythema and be pruritic. Bald patches may enlarge to involve large 
areas of the scalp or other hair-­bearing areas. Many experience good 
 

--- Page 251 ---
200    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
hair regrowth within 1 to 2 years, although most will relapse. A minor-
ity progress to total loss of all scalp (alopecia totalis) and/or body hair 
(alopecia universalis).
	2.	 Diagnosis: Usually clinical diagnosis.
	3.	 Treatment13: First-­line therapy is topical steroids. Referral to dermatology 
is warranted for consideration of other treatments. No evidence-­based 
data that any therapy is better than placebo. Older children, adoles-
cents, and young adults with longstanding localized areas of hair loss 
have the best prognosis. 
C.  Traction Alopecia (see Fig. 8.20, Color Plates)
	1.	 Pathogenesis: Hairstyles that apply tension for long periods of time.
	2.	 Clinical presentation: Noninflammatory linear areas of hair loss at mar-
gins of hairline, part line, or scattered regions, depending on hairstyling 
procedures used.
	3.	 Treatment: Avoidance of styling products or styles that result in traction. 
If traction remains for long periods, condition may progress to perma-
nent scarring hair loss. 
D.  Trichotillomania and Hair Pulling
	1.	 Pathogenesis: Alopecia due to compulsive urge to pull out one’s own 
hair, resulting in irregular areas of incomplete hair loss. Mainly on the 
scalp; can involve eyebrows and eyelashes. Onset is usually after age 
10 and should be distinguished from hair twirling/pulling in younger 
children that resolves without treatment in most cases.
	2.	 Clinical presentation: Characterized by hair of differing lengths; area of 
hair loss can be unusual in shape.
	3.	 Treatment: Behavioral modification and consider psychiatric evaluation 
(can be associated with anxiety, depression, and obsessive-­compulsive 
disorder). 
V.  ACNE VULGARIS
A.  Pathogenetic Factors
Follicular hyperkeratinization, increased sebum production, Cutibacterium 
acnes (formerly Propionibacterium acnes) proliferation, and inflammation. 
B.  Risk Factors
Androgens, family history, and stress. No strong evidence that dietary 
habits affect acne. 
C.  Clinical Presentation
	1.	 Noninflammatory lesions
	
a.	 Closed comedone (whitehead): Accumulation of sebum and 
keratinous material, resulting in white/skin-­colored papules without 
surrounding erythema.
	
b.	 Open comedone (blackhead): Dilated follicles filled with keratino-
cytes, oils, and melanin.

	2.	 Inflammatory lesions: Papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts with evi-
dence of surrounding inflammation. Typically appear later in the course 
of acne. Nodulocystic presentations are more likely to lead to hyperpig-
mentation and/or permanent scarring. 
D.  Treatment14–16 (Table 8.2)
	1.	 Skin care: Gentle nonabrasive cleaning. Avoid picking or popping 
lesions. Vigorous scrubbing and abrasive cleaners can worsen acne.
	2.	 Topical first-­line therapies: Recommended for mild to moderate acne.
	
a.	 Retinoids (Table EC 8.B)
(1) Normalize follicular keratinization and decrease inflammation.
(2) A pea-­sized amount should be applied to cover the entire face.
(3) Risks: Cause irritation and dryness of skin. Retinoids should be 
used at night due to inactivation by sunlight. This class should 
not be used during pregnancy.
(4) Three topical retinoids (tretinoin, adapalene, and tazarotene) are 
available by prescription in the United States. Adapalene 0.1% 
gel has been approved for over-­the-­counter (OTC) use with 
significant efficacy.17

b.	 Benzoyl peroxide (BPO)
(1) Oxidizing agent with antibacterial and mild anticomedolytic 
properties.
(2) Washes may be most convenient formulation, as they can be 
used in the shower.
(3) Risks: Can bleach hair, clothing, towels, and sheets.
	
c.	 Salicylic acid: Topical comedolytic agent that may be found in OTC 
face washes and serves as an alternative to a topical retinoid.
	3.	 Topical antimicrobials:
	
a.	 Azelaic acid: Antimicrobial, comedolytic, and anti-­inflammatory. 
Recommended by the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) for the 
treatment of postinflammatory dyspigmentation (see Figures EC 8.P and 
EC 8.S). Available in a 15% gel and a 20% cream (more efficacious).18
	
b.	 Erythromycin and clindamycin: Avoid topical antibiotics as monother-
apy. Topical BPO should be concurrently used to optimize efficacy 
and avoid bacterial resistance.
	4.	 Oral antibiotics (Table EC 8.C): Recommended for moderate to severe 
inflammatory acne that is resistant to topical treatment. These medica-
tions should be used with BPO or topical retinoid. Do not use as mono-
therapy. Limit to 3 months to minimize bacterial resistance.
	
a.	 ≥8 years old: Doxycycline or minocycline
	
b.	 <8 years old, pregnancy, or tetracycline allergy: Azithromycin, eryth-
romycin, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.
	
c.	 Erythromycin should be used with care due to increased risk of resis-
tance. The AAD recommends reserving trimethoprim/sulfamethoxa-
zole for patients who have failed other treatments or are unable to 
tolerate tetracyclines and macrolides.
	5.	 Hormonal therapy: Reduces sebum production and androgen levels. 
Good option for pubertal females who have sudden onset of moder-
ate to severe hormonal acne (often on lower face, jawline) and have 
not responded to conventional first-­line therapies. Should not be used 
as monotherapy. Combination oral contraceptives (Ortho Tri-­Cyclen, 
Estrostep, and Yaz) or spironolactone (antiandrogen).
	6.	 Oral isotretinoin: Reserved for patients with severe nodular, cystic, or 
scarring acne who do not respond to traditional therapy or who cannot be 
weaned from oral antibiotics. Should be managed by a dermatologist. Most 
patients have complete resolution of their acne after 16 to 20 weeks of use.
	
a.	 Side effects:
(1) Teratogenicity: Patients and physicians are mandated by the FDA 
to comply with the iPledge program to eliminate fetal exposure to 
isotretinoin. Female patients with child-­bearing potential must use 
two forms of birth control with routine pregnancy testing.
(2) Hepatotoxicity, hyperlipidemia, and bone marrow suppression, 
a complete blood cell count, fasting lipid profile, and liver func-
tion tests should be obtained before initiation of therapy and 
repeated at 4 and 8 weeks.

VI.  COMMON NEONATAL DERMATOLOGIC CONDITIONS (FIG. 8.21; 
FIGS. 8.22–8.30, COLOR PLATES)
A.  Erythema Toxicum Neonatorum (see Fig. 8.22, Color Plates)
	1.	 Clinical presentation: Most common rash of full-­term infants; incidence 
declines with lower birth weight and prematurity. Appears as small ery-
thematous macules and papules that evolve into pustules on erythema-
tous bases. Rash most often occurs by 24 to 48 hours of life but can be 
present at birth or emerge as late as 2 to 3 weeks.
	2.	 Course: Self-­limited, resolves within 5 to 7 days; recurrences possible. 
B.  Transient Neonatal Pustular Melanosis (see Figs. 8.23–8.24, Color 
Plates)
	1.	 Clinical presentation: More commonly affects full-­term infants with 
darker pigmentation. At birth, appears as small pustules on non-­
erythematous bases that rupture and leave erythematous/hyperpig-
mented macules with a collarette of scale.
	2.	 Course: Self-­limited macules fade over weeks to months. 
C.  Miliaria (Heat Rash) (see Fig. 8.25, Color Plates)
	1.	 Clinical presentation: Common newborn rash associated with warmer 
climates, incubator use, or occlusion with clothes/dressings. Appears 
as small erythematous papules or pustules usually on face, scalp, or 
intertriginous areas.
	2.	 Course: Rash resolves when infant is placed in cooler environment or 
tight clothing/dressings are removed. 
D.  Milia (see Fig. 8.26, Color Plates)
	1.	 Clinical presentation: Common newborn lesions. Appears as 1-­ to 3-­mm 
white/yellow papules, frequently found on nose and face; due to reten-
tion of keratin and sebaceous materials in pilosebaceous follicles.
	2.	 Course: Self-­limited, resolves within first few weeks to few months of life. 
E.  Neonatal Acne (see Fig. 8.27, Color Plates)
	1.	 Clinical presentation: Seen in 20% of infants. Appears as inflammatory 
papules or pustules without comedones, usually on face and scalp. 
Secondary to effect of maternal and endogenous androgens on infant’s 
sebaceous glands.
	2.	 Course: Peaks around 1 month, resolves within a few months, usually 
without intervention. Does not increase risk of acne as an adolescent. 
F.  Seborrheic Dermatitis (Cradle Cap) (see Figs. 8.28–8.29, Color 
Plates)
	1.	 Clinical presentation: Erythematous plaques with greasy yellow scales. 
Located in areas rich with sebaceous glands, such as scalp, cheeks, 
ears, eyebrows, intertriginous areas, diaper area. Unknown etiology. 
Can be seen in newborns, more commonly in infants aged 1 to 4 
months.
	2.	 Course: Self-­limited and resolves within a few weeks to months.

	3.	 Treatment: Can remove scales on scalp with an emollient (e.g., mineral 
or olive oil, or petroleum jelly) and a soft brush/fine comb. In more 
severe cases, antifungal shampoos or low-­potency topical steroid can 
shorten the course, although no shampoos are FDA-­approved for chil-
dren less than 2 years of age. 
G.  Congenital Dermal Melanocytosis (formerly known as Mongolian Spots)
	1.	 Clinical presentation: Most common pigmented lesion of newborns, 
usually seen in babies with darker skin tone. Appear as blue/gray 
macules without definite disappearance of dermal melanocytes. Can be 
mistaken for child abuse thus accurate documentation at newborn and 
well-­child visits is important.
	2.	 Course: Spots typically fade within first few years of life, with majority 
resolved or much improved by age 10 years. 
H.  Diaper Dermatitis19 (see Fig. 8.30, Color Plates)
	1.	 Clinical presentation: Irritant contact dermatitis characterized by 
erythematous eruption on buttocks and genital areas with exclusion 
of other potential causes. Rarely associated with diaper candidiasis, 
characterized by a red, raised papular rash with small pustules at the 
periphery. Tends to involve the skin creases.19
	2.	 Treatment: Frequent diaper changes, air exposure, adequate drying, 
gentle cleaning, and judicious use of topical barrier preparations. If per-
sistent, can use low-­potency topical steroid until cleared. For candidiasis, 
treatment with topical nystatin, miconazole, or clotrimazole is sufficient. 
Combination steroid/antifungal creams should be avoided due to steroid-­
related side effects and association with persistent fungal infections.20 
VII.  AUTOIMMUNE AND ALLERGIC DERMATOLOGIC CONDITIONS 
(FIGS. 8.31–8.38, COLOR PLATES)
A.  Contact Dermatitis
	1.	 Irritant dermatitis: Exposure to physical, chemical, or mechanical irri-
tants to the skin. Common irritants include frequent hand washing, hot 
water, lip-­licking, thumb-­sucking, and exposure to chemicals, paints, or 
certain foods like citrus fruits.
	2.	 Allergic dermatitis (see Fig. 8.31, Color Plates):
	
a.	 Pathogenesis: Immune reaction to an environmental trigger that 
comes into contact with the skin. After initial sensitization period of 
7 to 10 days in susceptible individuals, an allergic response occurs 
with subsequent exposures.
	
b.	 Common allergens: Toxicodendron spp. (poison ivy, oak, sumac), 
nickel, cobalt, gold, dyes, fragrances, formaldehyde, and latex.
	
c.	 Clinical presentation: Pruritic erythematous dermatitis that can prog-
ress to chronic scaling, lichenification, and pigment changes. Poison 
ivy (see Fig. 8.32, Color Plates): Exposure to urushiol causes streaks 
of erythematous papules, pustules, and vesicles. Highly pruritic, 
can become edematous, especially if rash is on face or genitals. In 
extreme cases, anaphylaxis can occur.

206    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	
d.	 Diagnosis: Careful history taking and recognition of unusual shapes 
and locations suggesting an “outside job” allow for clinical diagnosis. 
Patch testing may also be helpful when trigger cannot be identified.
	
e.	 Treatment:
(1) Remove causative agent. Moisturize with ointment like Vaseline 
or Aquaphor twice per day. Use antihistamine and/or oatmeal 
baths as needed for itching, sedation, and sleeping, though they 
do not directly impact the rash.
(2) Mild/moderate: Topical steroids twice a day for 1 week, then 
daily for 1 to 2 weeks.
(3) Widespread/severe: Systemic steroids for 2 to 3 weeks, with 
taper. There is no role for short courses of steroids because 
eruption will flare when drug is stopped.
(4) For poison ivy contact, remove clothing and wash skin with mild 
soap and water as soon as possible. 
B.  Atopic Dermatitis (Eczema) (See Figs. 8.33–8.37, Color Plates)
	1.	 Pathogenesis: Due to inadequate skin barrier function from combination 
of genetic and environmental factors, resulting in transepidermal water 
loss. Can be associated with elevated serum IgE.
	2.	 Epidemiology21: Affects up to 20% of children in the United States, the 
vast majority with onset before age 5 years. Other comorbidities may 
follow including asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergies. Eczema 
resolves or improves in over 75% of patients by adulthood.
	3.	 Clinical presentation: Dry, pruritic skin with acute changes, including 
erythema, vesicles, crusting, and chronic changes, including scaling, 
postinflammatory hypo-­ or hyperpigmentation (see Figures EC 8.P and 
EC 8.S), and lichenification.
	
a.	 Infantile form: Erythematous, scaly lesions on the cheeks, scalp, and 
extensor surfaces. Covered areas (especially the diaper area) are 
usually spared.
	
b.	 Childhood form: Lichenified plaques in flexural areas.
	
c.	 Adolescence: More localized and lichenified skin changes. 
Predominantly on skin flexures, hands, and feet.
	4.	 Treatment21: See Chapter 15
	
a.	 Lifestyle: Avoiding triggers (products with alcohol, fragrances, astrin-
gents, sweat, allergens, and excessive bathing). Avoid scratching 
(eczema is the “itch that rashes”).
	
b.	 Bathing: Should be less than 5 minutes in lukewarm water with a 
gentle bar soap and no washcloth or scrubbing. Skin should be 
patted dry (not rubbed) and followed by rapid application of an emol-
lient (“soak and smear”).
	
c.	 Consider diluted bleach baths once or twice a week (mix 1/4 cup of 
bleach in full tub of lukewarm water and soak for 10 minutes, then 
rinse off with fresh water).
	
d.	 Skin hydration: Frequent use of bland emollients with minimal water 
content (Vaseline or Aquaphor). Avoid lotions, as they have high 
water and low oil content, which worsens dry skin.

e.	 Oral antihistamines: There is little evidence that antihistamines 
improve skin lesions in atopic dermatitis. Non-­sedating antihista-
mines can be used for environmental allergies and hives. Sedating 
antihistamines may be of transient benefit for sedation at bedtime.
	
f.	 Treatment for inflammation:
(1) Mild disease: Topical steroids22 (Table 8.3): Low and medium 
potency steroid ointments once or twice daily for 7 days dur-
ing a flare. Severe flares may require a high-­potency steroid 
for a longer duration of therapy, followed by a taper to a low-­
potency steroid. Use of topical steroids in areas where skin 
is thin (groin, axilla, face, under breasts) should generally be 
avoided. Short durations of low-­potency steroids may be used 
as needed in these areas. Ointments can be applied over 
steroid.
(2) Moderate disease: Crisaborole is a topical PDE4 inhibitor 
approved for mild to moderate eczema with preliminary studies 
of the 2% ointment showing improvement in the majority of 
clinical signs and symptoms, particularly pruritus.23 Topical 
calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus ointment, pimecrolimus cream) 
are second-­line therapies which should only be used in con-
sultation with a dermatologist due to FDA “black box” warnings 
on these medications for theoretical increased risk of cancer, 
although there are no data to confirm and long-­term safety stud-
ies are pending.24,25
(3) Severe disease: Phototherapy with narrowband UVB light is a 
treatment option for older children and adolescents. Low-­dose 
methotrexate is a consideration before cyclosporine. For many 
dermatologists, low-­dose oral methotrexate is the first oral option 
for severe disease unresponsive to aggressive topical therapy. 
Oral cyclosporine is only used in severe cases of older children 
and adolescents who have failed other treatments due to con-
cern for renal compromise. Dupilumab is an IL-­4 receptor alpha 
antagonist prescribed for refractory cases, currently with FDA 
approval only for treatment in adults.
	5.	 Complications26:
	
a.	 Bacterial superinfection: Usually S. aureus, sometimes Group A 
Streptococcus. Depending on extent of infection, treat with topical 
mupirocin or systemic antibiotics.
	
b.	 Eczema herpeticum superinfection with herpes simplex virus can 
cause severe systemic infection. Presents as vesiculopustular 
lesions with central punched-­out erosions that do not respond to oral 
antibiotics. Must be treated systemically with acyclovir or valacyclovir. 
Should be evaluated by ophthalmologist if there is concern for eye 
involvement. 
C.  Papular Urticaria (See Fig. 8.38, Color Plates)
	1.	 Pathogenesis: Type IV hypersensitivity reaction to fleas, mosquitos, or 
bedbugs; also known as insect bite–induced hypersensitivity (IBIH).

	2.	 Clinical presentation/epidemiology: Summarized by the SCRATCH 
principles27:
	
a.	 Symmetric eruption: Exposed areas and scalp commonly affected. 
Spares diaper region, palms, and soles.
	
b.	 Cluster: Appear as “meal clusters” or “breakfast, lunch, and dinner” 
which are linear or triangular groupings of lesions. Associated with 
bedbugs and fleas.
	
c.	 Rover not required: A remote animal exposure or lack of pet at home 
does not rule out IBIH.
	
d.	 Age: Tends to peak by age 2. Not seen in newborn period. Most tend 
to develop tolerance by age 10.
	
e.	 Target lesions: Especially in darkly pigmented patients. Time: 
Emphasize chronic nature of eruption and need for patience and 
watchful waiting.
	
f.	 Confused pediatrician/parent: Diagnosis often met with disbelief by 
parent and/or referring pediatrician.
	
g.	 Household: Because of the nature of the hypersensitivity, usually only 
affects one family member in the household.
	3.	 Management (3 Ps):
	
a.	 Prevention: Wear protective clothing, use insect repellent when 
outside (AAP guidelines recommend up to 30% DEET or 12% picari-
din containing repellents), launder bedding and mattress pads for 
bedbugs, and maximize flea control for pets.
	
b.	 Pruritis control: Topical steroids or antihistamines may be of some 
benefit.
	
c.	 Patience: Can be frustrating because of its persistent, recurrent 
nature. Ensure patients that their symptoms will resolve and they will 
eventually develop tolerance. 
D.  Stevens-­Johnson Syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis
	1.	 Pathogenesis: Severe mucocutaneous reaction with partial to full 
epidermal necrosis due to keratinocyte necrosis. Stevens-­Johnson 
syndrome (SJS) has less than 10% involvement of body surface area 
(BSA), whereas toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) has greater than 
30% BSA involvement. SJS/TEN defines the gap of 10% to 30% 
involvement. Overall mortality for pediatric patients is less than 8%. 
Commonly caused by medications initiated in previous 8 weeks includ-
ing sulfonamide antibiotics, lamotrigine, carbamazepine, phenobarbi-
tal, and several oncologic drugs. May also be caused by Mycoplasma 
pneumonia infections. Nearly one third of cases have no identified 
trigger.
	2.	 Clinical presentation: Fever and flu-­like prodrome for 1 to 3 days prior to 
mucocutaneous lesions. Ophthalmologic and oropharyngeal symp-
toms are often first sites of mucosal involvement. Urogenital mucosal 
involvement seen in two-­thirds of patients may lead to urinary retention 
and have significant long-­term anatomic changes in female patients. 
Epidermal lesions are described as exquisitely tender (with pain out of

proportion), ill-­defined, coalescing macules and patches of erythema 
with central purple-­to-­black areas. Lesions typically start on face and 
trunk then spread in a symmetric distribution sparing the scalp, palms, 
and soles. Bullae form with disease progression. Then, the epidermis 
sloughs with positive Nikolsky and Asboe-­Hansen (lateral expansion 
of bullae with pressure) signs. Acute phase may last 8 to 12 days with 
reepithelization requiring up to four weeks.
	3.	 Diagnosis: Although usually not necessary, clinical diagnosis may be 
confirmed with a skin biopsy. Additional work up includes CBC, CMP, 
ESR, CRP, bacterial and fungal cultures, M. pneumoniae PCR, and 
CXR.
	4.	 Treatment: Remove offending agent, supportive care, and close monitor-
ing of all organ systems in the inpatient/ICU setting. There is controversy 
regarding IVIG and single dose of TNF-­alpha inhibitor early in course. 
Systemic steroids probably should not be used.
	5.	 Complications: At risk for serious complications including secondary 
bacterial infections (Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aerugi-
nosa), septic shock, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome 
(ARDS), and epithelial necrosis of the GI tract. Most common complica-
tion in children is corneal scarring and dry eye.

A.  Autoimmune and Allergic Lesions
	1.	 Autoimmune bullous diseases
	
a.	 Very rare in children but should be considered if bullous lesions do 
not respond to standard therapy. Suspicion for any of the follow-
ing should warrant referral to a dermatologist for diagnosis and 
management.
	
b.	 Pemphigus vulgaris (Figure EC 8.A):
(1) Pathogenesis: IgG autoantibodies to epidermal adhesion mol-
ecules, which interrupt integrity of epidermis and/or mucosa and 
result in extensive blister formation.
(2) Clinical presentation: Flaccid bullae that start in the mouth and 
spread to face, scalp, trunk, extremities, and other mucosal 
membranes. Positive Nikolsky sign. Ruptured blisters are painful 
and prone to secondary infection. Can lead to impaired oral 
intake if there is significant oral mucosal involvement.
(3) Treatment: Systemic glucocorticoids, rituximab, and/or intrave-
nous immunoglobulin.
	
c.	 Pemphigus foliaceus:
(1) Pathogenesis: IgG autoantibodies bind to the same antigen as 
in bullous impetigo and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome; 
thus lesions are superficial and rupture easily. Can be triggered 
by certain drugs, including thiol compounds and penicillins.
(2) Clinical presentation: Scaling, crusting erosions on erythematous base 
that appear on face, scalp, trunk, and back. No mucosal involve-
ment. Lesions are more superficial than in pemphigus vulgaris.
(3) Treatment: Systemic glucocorticoids or rituximab. There is cur-
rently a move away from systemic steroids due to good efficacy 
and safety data on rituximab.
	
d.	 Bullous pemphigoid:
(1) Pathogenesis: Autoantibodies to the epithelial basement mem-
brane that results in an inflammatory cascade and causes separa-
tion of epidermis from dermis and epithelium from subepithelium.

(2) Clinical presentation: Prodrome of inflammatory lesions that 
progresses into large (1 to 3 cm), tense, extremely pruritic bullae 
on trunk, flexural regions, and intertriginous areas. Few patients 
have oral mucosal lesions. Negative Nikolsky sign.
(3) Treatment: Immunosuppression (topical glucocorticoids, 
systemic glucocorticoids, glucocorticoid-­sparing agents like 
methotrexate, mycophenolate, or azathioprine).
	
e.	 Dermatitis herpetiformis:
(1) Pathogenesis: Strong genetic predisposition and link to gluten 
intolerance/celiac disease. IgA deposits found in dermal papillae.
(2) Clinical presentation: Symmetric, intensely pruritic papulovesi-
cles clustered on extensor surfaces.
(3) Treatment: Dapsone, strict gluten-­free diet. 
B.  Nail Disorders28
	1.	 Acquired nail disorders
	
a.	 Paronychia: Red, tender swelling of proximal or lateral nail folds 
(Figures EC 8.B and EC 8.C)
(1) Acute form: Caused by bacterial invasion after trauma to cuticle
	
(a)	 Clinical features: Exquisite pain, sudden swelling, and 
abscess formation around one nail.
	
(b)	 Treatment: Responds quickly to drainage of abscess and 
warm tap-­water soaks; occasionally anti-­staphylococcal 
antibiotics required.

(2) Chronic form: May involve one or several nails, history of fre-
quent exposure to water or thumb-­sucking; causative organisms 
Candida species, usually C. albicans.
	
(a)	 Clinical features: Mild tenderness, minimal purulence, nail 
may be discolored or dystrophic.
	
(b)	 Treatment: Resolves with topical antifungal agents and water 
avoidance; heals without scarring when thumb-­sucking ends.
	
b.	 Nail dystrophy: Distortion and discoloration of normal nail-­plate struc-
ture; often traumatic or inflammatory causes (Figures EC 8.D-EC 8.I).
(1) Onychomycosis: A result of dermatophyte fungal infection, 
unusual before puberty. Oral and topical antifungals (terbinafine, 
itraconazole, ciclopirox) are used off-­label with high cure rates 
and few adverse effects.29
(2) Subungual hematoma: Brown-­black nail discoloration following 
crush injury. Usually resolves without treatment; large, painful 
blood collections may be drained. Must differentiate from mela-
noma and melanonychia.
	
c.	 Nail changes and systemic disease (Figures EC 8.J and EC 8.K)
	(1)	Clubbing: Complication of chronic lung or heart disease.
	(2)	Beau lines: Transverse, white lines/grooves that move distally 
with nail growth; due to growth arrest from systemic illness, 
medications, or toxins.
	(3)	Onychomadesis: Accentuated Beau lines often with separation 
of the nail from base of nail. Usually self-­limited and very com-
mon following Coxsackie A6 hand, foot, and mouth disease.

C.  Disorders of Pigmentation30
	1.	 Hyperpigmentation
	
a.	 Congenital melanocytic nevi (CMN): Melanocytic nevi that are either 
present at birth or appear within the first few months of life in 1% to 
3% of neonates.31
(1) Appearance: Black or tan in color with irregular borders and 
often dark terminal hairs.
(2) Risks:
	
(a)	 Melanoma—At least 5% of large CMN greater than 20 cm 
with 70% of this cohort having cancerous transformation 
by 10 years of age.32 The presence of approximately 20 
satellite nevi (smaller congenital nevi) also increases risk of 
melanoma.
	
(b)	Neurocutaneous melanosis—Children with large, multiple, 
satellite nevi, or lesions over the spine are at risk for lepto-
meningeal involvement with symptoms that may include 
hydrocephalus and seizures that may require evaluation by 
gadolinium contrast MRI.33,34
	
b.	 Epidermal melanosis: Most lesions appear tan or light brown
(1) Café au lait spots (Figure EC 8.P): Discrete tan macules that 
appear at birth or during childhood in 10% to 20% of normal 
individuals, sizes vary from freckles to patches, may involve any

1 (≥6 lesions, each greater than 5 mm in diameter in prepubertal, 
or greater than 15 mm in postpubertal child) or other syndromes.
(2) Freckles (ephelides): Reddish-­tan and brown macules on sun-­
exposed surfaces, usually 2 to 3 mm in diameter. Serve as an 
independent risk factor for skin cancers in adulthood and can 
be an added sign of the importance of photoprotection which 
may decrease additional lesions.
(3) Acanthosis nigricans (Figures EC 8.Q and EC 8.R): Brown-­to-­
black hyperpigmentation with velvety or warty skin in intertrigi-
nous areas, typically found in the skin folds of the neck and

axilla. Most commonly occur in obese individuals with insulin 
resistance at risk for type II diabetes. Finding may decrease after 
puberty with weight reduction.
	
c.	 Dermal melanosis: Slate-­gray, dark brown, or bluish-­green lesions.
(1) Post-­inflammatory hyperpigmentation (Figure EC 8.S): Most 
common cause of increased pigmentation.
	
(a)	 Pathogenesis: Follows inflammatory processes in the skin 
(e.g., diaper dermatitis, insect bites, drug reactions, traumatic 
injuries).
	
(b)	 Clinical features: Localized lesions, follow distribution of resolv-
ing disorder. More prominent in darkly pigmented children.
	
(c)	 Treatment: Lesions typically fade over several months. 
Photoprotection is critical with protective clothing and 
sunscreen of at least SPF 30. Individuals should also avoid 
physical trauma to areas as well as medications that may 
worsen hyperpigmentation. Intervention with medication is 
not always required; however, when it is, hydroquinone is 
first-­line therapy.35
(2) Acquired nevomelanocytic nevi (aka pigmented nevi or moles) 
(Figure EC 8.T)
	
(a)	 Pathogenesis: Develop in early childhood as flat lesions 
called junctional nevi, then develop into compound nevi 
when nevus cells migrate into the dermis and lesions 
enlarge and become papular.
	
(b)	 Clinical features: Increase in darkness, size, and number dur-
ing puberty; generally do not exceed 5 mm and retain regular-
ity in color, texture, and symmetry; on sun-­exposed areas.
	
(c)	 Treatment: Excision unnecessary, unless cosmetic concern.

(d)	 Changes associated with development of melanoma: See 
ABCDEs of Melanoma as well as burning, itching, or redness.
(3) Melanomas (Figure EC 8.U)
	
(a)	 Pathogenesis: May occur de novo or within acquired or 
congenital nevi.
	
(b)	 Epidemiology: High lifetime risk in those with presence of 
multiple, large, and irregularly pigmented, bordered, tex-
tured nevi and family history of malignant melanomas.
	
(c)	 Management: Children in high-­risk families must be care-
fully observed for atypical nevi development especially in 
adolescence. Changing nevi with unusual appearance or an 
“ugly duckling” (mole that is different from all other moles) 
must be considered for biopsy.
	
(d)	 ABCDEs of Melanoma: Criteria for older children and adults is 
as follows: Asymmetric shape, Borders that are irregular, Color 
that is variable throughout lesion, Diameter greater than the 
size of a pencil eraser (>6 mm), Evolution (change is the most 
important factor in melanoma diagnosis).36 Pediatric patients 
up to age 20 have their own ABCD criteria: Amelanotic, 
Bleeding, Bump, Color uniformity, De novo, any Diameter.37
(4) Melanonychia (see Figure EC 8.G): Darkened nail pigment that 
most commonly is caused by melanin or hemosiderin deposits 
in the nail plate. Regular, organized longitudinal lines tend to be 
benign whereas irregularities are associated with nail melanoma 
in adults. However, nail matrix nevi in children often have features 
that would be considered red flags in the adult population; thus,

these criteria may not be applied to children. There are no pediat-
ric specific guidelines for management. Typically, this clinical find-
ing is due to nail matric nevi. Nail melanomas are very rare though 
children with this clinical finding warrant close follow up.38,39
(5) Spitz nevus (aka spindle and epithelial cell nevus) (Figure EC 
8.V): Innocent nevomelanocytic nevus often confused with 
malignant melanoma.
	
(a)	 Clinical features: Rapidly growing, dome-­shaped, red or 
reddish-­brown papules or nodules on face or lower extremi-
ties that reach full size quickly.
	
(b)	 Management: Observe if features of innocent acquired 
nevus are present. Consider referral to pediatric dermatology 
if unusual atypical features present.
	2.	 Hypopigmentation and depigmentation
	
a.	 Localized hypopigmentation
(1) Hypopigmented macules (Figure EC 8.W)
	
(a)	 Epidemiology: 0.1% to 0.5% of normal newborns have a 
single hypopigmented macule but it may be a marker for 
tuberous sclerosis as 70% to 90% of those affected have 
such macules on the trunk at birth.
	
(b)	 Clinical features: Trunk involvement is most com-
mon. Majority are lancet or ash-­leaf shaped, but may 
be round, oval, dermatomal, segmental, or irregularly 
shaped. Vary from pinpoint confetti spots to large 
patches (>10 cm).

(c)	 Diagnosis: Wood lamp helpful in lightly pigmented children.
	
(d)	 Management: In those where systemic disease is suspected, 
close observation for other cutaneous findings and systemic 
symptoms is indicated.
(2) Post-­inflammatory hypopigmentation (Figure EC 8.X)
	
(a)	 Pathogenesis: May appear after an inflammatory skin condition.
	
(b)	 Clinical features: Seen in association with primary lesions 
of underlying disorder (such as atopic dermatitis). Patches 
usually variable in size and irregularly shaped. Concomitant 
hyperpigmentation is common.
	
b.	 Diffuse hypopigmentation
(1) Albinism: Heterogeneous group of inherited disorders manifested 
by generalized hypopigmentation or depigmentation of skin, eyes, 
and hair. These individuals should undergo ophthalmologic exami-
nation to evaluate for various associated conditions. Sun protection 
is important as well as regular skin exams.
	3.	 Dyspigmentation
	
a.	 Blaschkoid dyspigmentation40: Congenital hypopigmentation and 
hyperpigmentation along the lines of Blaschko (Figure EC 8.Y).
	(1)	Patterns of hyper-­ or hypopigmentation: Whorl shape on trunk, 
V-­shape on the back, waves on the vertex scalp.
	(2)	Pathogenesis: Blaschko lines occur due to genetic mosaicism.
	(3)	Children unlikely to have or develop serious extracutaneous 
involvement.

Development, Behavior, and 
Developmental Disability

 See additional content on Expert Consult
I.  DEVELOPMENTAL DEFINITIONS1,2
A.  Developmental Streams
	1.	 Gross Motor Skills: Descriptions of posture and locomotion—in general, 
how a child moves from one location to another.
	2.	 Fine-­Motor and Visual-­Motor Problem-­Solving Skills: Upper extrem-
ity and hand manipulative abilities and hand-­eye coordination. These 
require an intact motor substrate and a given level of nonverbal cogni-
tive ability.
	3.	 Language: The ability to understand and communicate with another 
person. This is the best predictor of intellectual performance in the 
absence of a communication disorder or significant hearing impairment.
	4.	 Personal-­Social Skills: Communicative in origin; represent the cumula-
tive impact of language comprehension and problem-­solving skills.
	5.	 Adaptive Skills: Skills concerned with self-­help or activities of daily living. 
B.  Developmental Quotient (DQ)
	1.	 A calculation that reflects the rate of development in any given stream; 
represents the percentage of normal development present at the time of 
testing.
	
DQ =
Developmental age
Chronological age
× 100	
	2.	 Two separate developmental assessments over time are more predictive 
of later abilities than a single assessment.
	3.	 In contrast to developmental quotient (DQ), intelligence quotient (IQ) 
has statistical reliability and validity.2 
C.  Abnormal Development
	1.	 Delay: Performance significantly below average (DQ <70) in a given 
area of development. May occur in a single stream or several streams 
(“global developmental delay”).
	2.	 Deviancy: Atypical development within a single stream, such as devel-
opmental milestones occurring out of sequence. Deviancy does not 
necessarily imply abnormality, but should alert one to the possibility that 
problems may exist.
		
Example: An infant who rolls at an early age may have abnormally 
increased tone.
 

--- Page 293 ---
212    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	3.	 Dissociation: A substantial difference in the rate of development 
between two or more streams.
		
Example: Increased motor delay relative to cognition seen in some 
children with cerebral palsy (CP). 
II.  GUIDELINES FOR NORMAL DEVELOPMENT AND BEHAVIOR
A.  Developmental Milestones (Table 9.1)
Developmental assessment is based on the premise that milestone acquisi-
tion occurs at a specific rate in an orderly and sequential manner.
B.  Age-­Appropriate Behavioral Issues in Infancy and Early Childhood: 
See Table 9.2. 
III.  DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING AND EVALUATION OF 
DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS
A.  Developmental Surveillance and Screening Guidelines
	1.	 Developmental surveillance should be included in every well-­child 
visit, and any concerns should be addressed immediately with formal 
screening. This includes direct observation of the child and eliciting and 
attending to the parent’s concerns.
	2.	 Standardized developmental screening should be administered at 
9-­month, 18-­month, and 30-­month well-­child visits, in the absence of

mental delay or intellectual disability (ID) if the cause is not known (e.g., 
previous traumatic brain injury or neurologic insult). 
IV.  SPECIFIC DISORDERS OF DEVELOPMENT
A.  Overview
	1.	 Mental and/or physical impairment(s) that cause significant limitations 
in functioning.
	2.	 Developmental diagnosis is a functional description; identification of an 
etiology is important to further inform treatment, prognosis, comorbidi-
ties, and future risk.

AGE-­APPROPRIATE BEHAVIORAL ISSUES IN INFANCY AND EARLY CHILDHOOD
Age
Behavioral Issue
Symptoms
Guidance
1–3 months
Colic
Paroxysms of fussiness/crying, ≥3 per day, ≥3 days/
week, may pull knees up to chest, pass flatus
Crying usually peaks at 6 weeks and resolves by 3–4 months. Prevent overstimu-
lation; swaddle infant; use white noise, swing, or car rides to soothe. Avoid 
medication and formula changes. Encourage breaks for the primary caregiver.
3–4 months
Trained night 
feeding
Night awakening
Comfort quietly, avoid reinforcing behavior (i.e., avoid night feeds). Do not play 
at night. Introducing cereal or solid food does not reduce awakening. Develop 
a consistent bedtime routine. Place baby in bed while drowsy and not fully 
asleep.
9 months
Stranger anxiety/
separation 
anxiety
Distress when separated from parent or approached 
by a stranger
Use a transitional object (e.g., special toy, blanket). Use routine or ritual to separate 
from parent. May continue until 24 months but can reduce in intensity.
Developmental 
night waking
Separation anxiety at night
Keep lights off. Avoid picking child up or feeding. May reassure verbally at regular 
intervals or place a transitional object in crib.
12 months
Aggression
Biting, hitting, kicking in frustration
Say “no” with negative facial cues. Begin time out (1 minute/year of age). No eye 
contact or interaction, place in a nonstimulating location. May restrain child 
gently until cooperation is achieved.
Need for limit 
setting
Exploration of environment, danger of injury
Avoid punishing exploration or poor judgment. Emphasize child-­proofing and 
distraction.
18 months
Temper tantrums
Occur with frustration, attention-­seeking rage, 
negativity/refusal
Try to determine cause, react appropriately (i.e., help child who is frustrated, 
ignore attention-­seeking behavior). Make sure child is in a safe location.
24 months
Toilet training
Child needs to demonstrate readiness: shows interest, 
neurologic maturity (i.e., recognizes urge to urinate 
or defecate), ability to walk to bathroom and undress 
self, desire to please/imitate parents, increasing 
periods of daytime dryness
Age range for toilet training is usually 2–4 years. Give guidance early; may 
introduce potty seat but avoid pressure or punishment for accidents. Wait until 
the child is ready. Expect some periods of regression, especially with stressors.

New sibling
Regression, aggressive behavior
Allow for special time with parent, 10–20 min daily of one-­on-­one time exclusively 
devoted to the older sibling(s). Child chooses activity with parent. No interrup-
tions. May not be taken away as punishment.
36 months
Nightmares
Awakens crying, may or may not complain of bad dream
Reassure child, explain that he or she had a bad dream. Leave bedroom door 
open, use a nightlight, demonstrate there are no monsters under the bed. 
Discuss dream the following day. Avoid scary movies or television shows.
Night terrors
Agitation, screaming 1–2 hours after going to bed. 
Child may have eyes open but not respond to parent. 
May occur at same time each night
May be familial, not volitional.
Prevention: For several nights, awaken child 15 min before terrors typically occur. 
Avoid overtiredness.
Acute: Be calm; speak in soft, soothing, repetitive tones; help child return to 
sleep. Protect child against injury.

Testing for X-­linked 
conditions
Consider genetic testing for X-­linked genes in boys with GDD/ID after 
negative CMA and negative fragile X testing. Should be specifically in 
those patients whose pedigree is suggestive of an X-­linked condition.
The tests discussed above do not require referral to a genetic specialist and can be ordered by 
the patient’s pediatrician as a part of the evaluation of global developmental delay/intellectual 
disability (GDD/ID). If unrevealing and severe DD/ID present, refer to genetic specialist for consid-
eration of additional testing such as metabolic testing or whole exome sequencing.

TABLE EC 9.B
SEVERITY LEVELS FOR INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY
Severity Level
Conceptual Domain
Social Domain
Mild
For preschool children, there may be no obvious conceptual differences. 
For school-­aged children and adults, there are difficulties in learning 
academic skills involving reading, writing, arithmetic, time, or money, 
with support needed in one or more areas to meet age-­related expecta-
tions. In adults, abstract thinking, executive function (i.e., planning, 
strategizing, priority setting, and cognitive flexibility), and short-­term 
memory, as well as functional use of academic skills (e.g., reading, 
money management) are impaired. There is a somewhat concrete 
approach to problems and solutions compared with age mates.
Compared with typically developing age mates, the individual is immature in 
social interactions (e.g., difficulty in accurately perceiving peers’ social cues). 
Communication, conversation, and language are more concrete or immature than 
expected for age. There may be difficulties regulating emotion and behavior in 
age-­appropriate fashion; these difficulties are noticed by peers in social situa-
tions. There is limited understanding of risk in social situations; social judgment 
is immature for age, and the person is at risk of being manipulated by others 
(gullibility).
Moderate
All through development, the individual’s conceptual skills lag markedly 
behind those of peers. For preschoolers, language and preacademic 
skills may develop slowly. For school-­aged children, progress in 
reading, writing, mathematics, and understanding of time and 
money occurs slowly across the school years, and is markedly limited 
compared with that of peers. For adults, academic skill development 
is typically at an elementary level, and support is required for all use 
of academic skills in work and personal life. Ongoing assistance on a 
daily basis is needed to complete conceptual tasks of day-­to-­day life, 
and others may take over these responsibilities fully for the individual.
The individual shows marked differences from peers in social and communicative 
behavior across development. Spoken language is typically a primary tool for 
social communication, but is much less complex than that of peers. Capacity for 
relationships is evident in ties to family and friends, and the individual may have 
successful friendships across life and sometimes romantic relations in adulthood. 
However, individuals may not perceive or interpret social cues accurately. Social 
judgment and decision-­making abilities are limited, and caretakers must assist 
the person with life decisions. Friendships with typically developing peers are often 
affected by communication or social limitations. Significant social and communica-
tive support is needed in work settings for success.

bers, quantity, time, and money. Caretakers provide extensive support 
for problem solving throughout life.
Spoken language is quite limited in terms of vocabulary and grammar. Speech may be 
single words or phrases, and may be supplemented through augmentative means. 
Speech and communication are focused on the here and now within everyday 
events. Language is used for social communication more than for explication. 
Individuals understand simple speech and gestural communication. Relationships 
with family members and familiar others are a source of pleasure and help.
Profound
Conceptual skills generally involve the physical world rather than 
symbolic processes. The individual may use objects in goal-­directed 
fashion for self-­care, work, and recreation. Certain visuospatial skills 
(e.g., matching and sorting based on physical characteristics) may be 
acquired. However, co-­occurring motor and sensory impairments may 
prevent functional use of objects.
The individual has very limited understanding of symbolic communication in speech 
or gesture. He or she may understand some simple instructions or gestures. The 
individual expresses his or her own desires and emotions largely through nonverbal, 
nonsymbolic communication. The individual enjoys relationships with well-­known 
family members, caretakers, and familiar others, and initiates and responds to 
social interactions through gestural and emotional cues. Co-­occurring sensory and 
physical impairments may prevent many social activities.

224    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	3.	 Diagnosis
	
a.	 Symptoms vary by age, developmental level, language ability, and 
supports in place.
	
b.	 Diagnostic criteria include4:
(1) Impaired social communication and interaction.
	
	
Examples: Lack of joint attention behaviors (e.g., showing toys, 
pointing for showing), diminished eye contact, no sharing of 
emotions, lack of imitation
(2) Restricted repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities.
	
	
Examples: Simple motor stereotypies (hand flapping, finger 
flicking), repetitive use of objects (spinning coins, lining up toys), 
repetitive speech (echolalia), resistance to change, unusual 
sensory responses
(3) Presentation in early childhood and significant limitation of 
functioning.
	4.	 Interventions/Treatment
	
a.	 Educational interventions, visual supports, naturalistic developmental 
behavioral interventions (integrating behavioral and child-­responsive 
strategies to teach developmentally appropriate skills in a more natu-
ral and interactive setting).16,17
	
b.	 Referral to SLP, OT/sensory-­based interventions.
G. Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: See Chapter 24 
V.  LONGITUDINAL CARE OF CHILDREN WITH DEVELOPMENTAL 
DISORDERS AND DISABILITIES
A.  Interdisciplinary Involvement
	1.	 Neurodevelopmental pediatrician, child neurologist, developmental/
behavioral pediatrician, other medical subspecialties as indicated (e.g., 
orthopedics for CP can be very important).
	2.	 Genetic counseling for families of children with a genetic condition.
	3.	 Psychologists for formal testing, counseling.
	4.	 Rehabilitation and therapists, including physical therapy (PT), occupa-
tional therapy (OT), and SLP.
	5.	 Educators 
B.  Relevant Laws and Regulation
	1.	 The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) sets forth 
­regulations in the following areas for states that receive federal 
funding6,18:
	
a.	 Entitles all children with qualifying disabilities to a free and 
­appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment.
	
b.	 Early intervention services: Infants and toddlers younger than 
3 years may be referred for evaluation to receive developmental 
services. Eligibility criteria vary by state; see The National Early 
Childhood Technical Assistance Center (www.ectacenter.org) for 
details.

c.	 Qualifying disabilities: Children aged 3 to 21 years with autism spec-
trum disorder, ID, specific learning disability (LD), hearing or visual 
impairment, speech or language impairment, orthopedic impairment, 
traumatic brain injury, emotional disturbance, or other health impair-
ment are eligible.
	
d.	 Individualized Education Program (IEP): Written statement that 
includes a child’s current capabilities, goals and how they will be 
measured, and services required. A comprehensive team is needed 
to develop and implement the IEP.
	
e.	 Transition Services: School systems must provide transitions services 
that prepare students for post-­secondary activities and IEPs must 
include a statement of transition service needs starting no later than 
age 14. The student must be included in the IEP process starting at 
age 14.
	2.	 Head Start and Early Head Start: Programs instituted by the federal 
government to promote school readiness of low-­income children 
aged 3 to 5 years and younger than 3 years, respectively, within their 
communities.19
	3.	 Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans 
with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibit discrimination against individuals 
with any disability, more broadly defined as an impairment that limits 
function.20 
VI.  TRANSITIONS FROM PEDIATRIC TO ADULT CARE FOR YOUTH 
WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES
A.  The Need
Research reveals health disparities between adults with developmental dis-
abilities and those without. Disparities include:
	1.	 Increased ED utilization
	2.	 Lack of identified adult provider
	3.	 Worse self-­perception of health21 
B.  The Role of the Pediatric Provider
AAP Consensus Statement on Transitions22,23:
	1.	 Identify a health professional as point person to work with the youth and 
family on transition process.
	2.	 Create health care transition plan by age 14 with the youth and family.
	3.	 Apply same guidelines for primary and preventive care for all adoles-
cents and young adults.
	4.	 Ensure affordable, continuous insurance coverage. 
C.  Transition Domains
Transitions for young adults with disabilities occur across many domains of 
life and warrant support from an interdisciplinary team (Table 9.10).

I.  DIABETES
A.  Diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus1-­3
Diagnostic criteria (must meet one of four):
	1.	 Symptoms of diabetes (polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, frequent yeast 
infections) and random blood glucose (BG) ≥200 mg/dL
	2.	 Fasting plasma glucose (FPG = no caloric intake for at least 8 hours) 
≥126 mg/dL
	3.	 Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with a 2-­hour post-­load plasma 
glucose of ≥200 mg/dL
	4.	 Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥6.5%
NOTE: In the absence of symptoms of hyperglycemia, FPG or OGTT should 
be repeated on another day. 
B.  Definition of Increased Risk (Prediabetes)
	1.	 FPG 100 to 125 mg/dL
	2.	 2-­hour post-­OGTT 140 to 199 mg/dL
	3.	 HbA1c 5.7% to 6.4% 
C.  Interpreting Hemoglobin A1c1,2
	1.	 Estimates average BG for the past 3 months.
	2.	 HbA1c of 6% approximately equals an average BG of 130 mg/dL; each 
additional 1% ≈ 30 mg/dL more.
	3.	 Unreliable in patients with abnormal red cell lifespan or morphology 
(e.g., sickle cell disease, spherocytosis).
	4.	 Although the HbA1c criterion has been accepted by the American 
Diabetes Association for the diagnosis of diabetes in adults, this criterion 
remains controversial in children, especially as it relates to type 2 diabe-
tes mellitus (T2DM). 
D.  Etiology: Distinguishing Between Types of Diabetes Mellitus1,2
	1.	 Type 1 (T1DM) versus T2DM (most common types, polygenic; Table 10.1)
	2.	 Other forms of diabetes4,5
	
a.	 Monogenic diabetes: 1% to 2% of diabetes mellitus (DM). Due to 
single-­gene mutations, typically relating to insulin production or 
release. Identifying gene can have clinical significance.
(1) Suspect if autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of early-­onset 
(<25 years) DM, insulin independence, absent T2DM phenotype 
(non-­obese), or preservation of C-­peptide.
 

--- Page 318 ---
Chapter 10  Endocrinology    229
10
(2) Well-­described subtypes: MODY1 and MODY3, due to mutations 
in transcription factors for insulin production; responsive to 
sulfonylureas.
	
b.	 Neonatal diabetes (NDM): Defined as DM onset <6 months of age.
(1) Rare: 1:160,000 to 260,000 live births, typically a de novo 
mutation
(2) May be transient (50% recur) or permanent
(3) Subset respond to sulfonylureas
	
c.	 Cystic fibrosis-­related diabetes (CFRD): OGTT rather than HbA1c is 
the recommended screening test.
	
d.	 Other causes of DM: Diseases of exocrine pancreas due to pancreati-
tis, trauma, infection, invasive disease (e.g., hemochromatosis). 
E.  Screening for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus1,6
	1.	 Who to screen: Children who are overweight [body mass index (BMI)  
>85th percentile] and have one or more of the following risk factors:
	
a.	 Maternal history of diabetes or gestational diabetes mellitus during 
child’s gestation
	
b.	 Family history of T2DM in a first-­ or second-­degree relative
	
c.	 Race/ethnicity: African American, Native American, Hispanic, Asian, 
or Pacific Islander
	
d.	 Signs associated with insulin resistance (acanthosis nigricans, 
hypertension, dyslipidemia, polycystic ovarian syndrome, or small-­
for-­gestational-­age birth weight)
	2.	 How to screen: Fasting plasma glucose, OGTT, or HbA1c
	3.	 When to screen: Begin at the age of 10 years or at the onset of puberty 
(whichever occurs first), and repeat at a minimum of every 3 years or 
more often if BMI is increasing.

F.  Additional Testing in New-­Onset Diabetes
	1.	 Diabetes autoantibodies1,2: Recommended for all children with suspected 
T2DM. No universal agreement regarding whether to test all patients.
	
a.	 Includes islet cell autoantibodies (ICAs) and antibodies to GAD 
(GAD65), insulin, and tyrosine phosphotases IA-­2, IA-­2β, ZnT8.
	
b.	 Suggestive of T1DM if present, though about 5% of T1DM will not 
have measurable ICAs, and some children with T2DM will have 
measureable ICAs.
	2.	 Screening for autoimmune diseases in T1DM6:
	
a.	 Thyroid disease (present in 17% to 30% of patients with T1DM): 
Screen with TSH when clinically well and consider screening for thy-

if symptoms develop.
	
b.	 Celiac disease (present in 1.6% to 16.4% of patients with T1DM):

IgA. Repeat within 2 years of diabetes diagnosis and again after 5 
years. Repeat more frequently if there are symptoms or a first degree 
relative with celiac disease.

	1.	 Diabetes medications FDA-­approved for children:
	
a.	 Insulin: See Tables 10.2 and 10.3 for calculations. Insulin doses are 
subsequently adjusted based on actual blood sugars.
	
b.	 Metformin: FDA-­approved in children ≥10 years old, though 
sometimes used off-­label in younger children. Main side effects are

gastrointestinal and are often transient. Extended release option 
available for patients with GI side effects.
	2.	 T1DM management: The majority of children with T1DM should be 
treated with intensive insulin regimens, either via multiple daily injec-
tions or continuous subcutaneous infusion.
	3.	 T2DM management:
	
a.	 Lifestyle modification therapy (nutrition and physical activity) and 
metformin should be initiated at time of diagnosis.
	
b.	 Insulin therapy should be initiated if distinction between T1DM and 
T2DM is unclear, when HbA1c ≥8.5%, when random BG ≥250, or when 
patient with known T2DM is not meeting glycemic target with metformin 
and lifestyle modification alone. NOTE: If significant hyperglycemia (BG > 
600) or ketosis is present, patient should be evaluated for DKA/HHS.
	4.	 Goals of therapy: A1c <7.5% for T1DM and <7% for T2DM in patients 
on metformin alone (individualized to avoid excessive hypoglycemia).
	5.	 Interdisciplinary care team should include mental health provider and 
medical nutrition therapy with initial education and annual update. 
Regularly assess for eating disorders, disease-­related coping, depres-
sion, and psychosocial stressors impacting diabetes management.

below.
	2.	 Insulin pumps: Contain rapid acting insulin only and provide basal and 
bolus insulin. Doses can be programmed to vary throughout the day.

a.	 Basal rate—continuous insulin infusion
	
b.	 Carbohydrate coverage—insulin to carbohydrate ratio
	
c.	 Hyperglycemia correction—based on correction factor and target 
blood glucose
NOTE: There is risk for DKA with interruptions in insulin delivery (e.g., 
pump malfunction) given lack of long-­acting insulin.
	3.	 Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs): Measure glucose concentration in 
interstitial fluid continuously and provide alerts for high and low glucose 
levels.
	4.	 Sensor augmented insulin pump therapy: Integration of continuous glucose 
monitor and insulin pump to adjust insulin delivery based on blood glucose. 
I.  Monitoring6,8,9,11
	1.	 Glycemic control:
	
a.	 Assessment of blood glucose using glucometer or CGM—multiple 
times daily (before meals/snacks, at bedtime, prior to exercise, with 
symptoms of hypoglycemia, after treating for hypoglycemia, before 
driving, etc.)
	
b.	 HbA1c every 3 months
	2.	 Urine ketones should be checked with persistent hyperglycemia, any 
illness (regardless of blood glucose level), or with nausea/vomiting.
	3.	 Associated conditions or complications: See Table 10.4. 
J.  Diabetic Emergencies12,13
	1.	 Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)
	
a.	 Definition: Hyperglycemia (or euglycemia in a patient with known 
diabetes), ketonemia, ketonuria, and metabolic acidosis (pH <7.30, 
bicarbonate <15 mEq/L)
	
b.	 BG reflects hydration status, pH reflects DKA severity
	
c.	 Symptoms: Nausea, emesis, abdominal pain, fruity breath, altered 
mental status, Kussmaul respirations
	
d.	 Precipitating factors: New-­onset DM, known diabetes with missed 
insulin doses, insulin pump/infusion site malfunction, or physiologic 
stress due to acute illness
	
e.	 Management: See Fig. 10.1. Because the fluid and electrolyte 
requirements vary greatly from patient to patient, guidelines are 
only a starting point and therapy must be individualized based on 
patient characteristics. NOTE: Initial insulin administration may cause 
transient worsening of the acidosis as potassium is driven into cells 
in exchange for hydrogen ions.
	
f.	 Cerebral edema: Most severe complication of DKA. Overly aggres-
sive hydration and rapid correction of hyperglycemia may play 
a role in its development. Risk factors include severe acidosis, 
evidence of renal insufficiency, young age and new onset, use of 
bicarbonate.

g.	 Once DKA is resolved, transition to subcutaneous (SQ) insulin. See 
Tables 10.2 and 10.3 for calculations or resume home insulin doses.
	2.	 Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS)
	
a.	 Definition: Extreme hyperglycemia (BG >600 mg/dL) and hyperos-
molarity (>320 mOsm/kg), without significant ketosis or acidosis.
	
b.	 Characteristics of HHS: Gradually increasing polyuria and polydipsia 
leading to profound dehydration, altered consciousness.
	
c.	 Management:
(1) Fluids: Fluids alone will decrease BG due to dilution, promotion 
of glucosuria, and increased glucose uptake with improved cir-
culation. Fluid replacement should be more rapid than in DKA 
with goal of gradual decline in serum sodium (about 0.5 mEq/
dL/h) and osmolality. Bolus ≥20 cc/kg 0.9% saline and repeat 
until perfusion improved. Then start maintenance fluids plus 
deficit replacement over 24 to 48 hours using 0.45% to 0.75% 
saline (if perfusion inadequate, consider isotonic fluids). Urine 
output should also be replaced.
(2) Insulin therapy: Start insulin (0.025 to 0.05 unit/kg/h) when BG 
no longer declining at least 50 mg/dL/h with fluids alone. Titrate 
insulin to decrease BG by 75 to 100 mg/dL/h.

stimulating hormone (TSH [4 to 10 mIU/L]), with normal or slightly elevated 
triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) are seen in 10% to 23% of obese 
children. There does not appear to be a benefit to treating these individuals. 
Values tend to normalize with weight loss. Could consider testing for thyroid 
antibodies to further clarify whether there is true thyroid dysfunction.

HYPOTHYROIDISM55,56
Clinical Symptoms
Onset
Etiology
Management
Follow-­up
PRIMARY/CONGENITAL
Large fontanelles, lethargy, con-
stipation, hoarse cry, hypotonia, 
hypothermia, jaundice. Most 
often picked up on newborn 
screen.
Symptoms usually develop by 
2 weeks; almost always by 
6 weeks.
Some infants may be relatively 
asymptomatic if not caused 
by absence of thyroid gland.
Primary: Defect of fetal thyroid 
development most common. 
Other causes include TSH 
receptor mutation or thyroid 
dyshormonogenesis.
OR
 Central: Deficiency of TSH or 
thyrotropin-­releasing hormone 
(TRH).
Replacement with L-­thyroxine 
once newborn screen is 
positive, pending results of 
confirmatory testing.a Goal T4 
in upper half of normal range. 
In primary hypothyroidism, 
TSH should be kept in normal 
range for age.
Monitor T4 and TSH 1–2 weeks 
after initiation and then every 
2 weeks until TSH normalizes. 
Once levels are adequate fol-
low per schedule listed below.
Treated patients are still at risk 
for developmental delay.
ACQUIRED
Growth deceleration, coarse brittle 
hair, dry skin, delayed tooth 
eruption, cold intolerance.
Can occur as early as 2 years 
old.
Primary: Can be caused by 
Hashimoto thyroiditis (diagnosis 
supported by + antithyroglobu-
lin or antimicrosomal antibod-
ies), head/neck radiation.
OR
 Central: Caused by pituitary/
hypothalamic insults including 
brain tumor.
Replacement with l-­thyroxine.a 
Targets for TSH and T4 same 
as for congenital hypothyroid-
ism above.
Follow every 1–3 months during 
the first 12 months, every 2–4 
months until 3 years, and 
then every 3–12 months until 
growth complete. Follow 4–6 
weeks after any dose change.
aBecause of the risk of inducing adrenal crisis if adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency is present, the treatment of central hypothyroidism should not be started until normal ACTH/cortisol function is 
documented.
NOTE: Thyroid hormone levels in premature infants are lower than those seen in full-­term infants. Furthermore, the TSH surge seen at approximately 24 hours of age in full-­term babies does not appear in preterm infants. 
In this population, lower levels are associated with increased illness; however, the effect of replacement therapy remains controversial.

	3.	 Newborn screening for hypothyroidism16,20: Mandated in all 50 states. 
Measures a combination of TSH and T4, based on the particular state’s 
algorithm; 1:25 abnormal tests are confirmed. Congenital hypothyroid-
ism has prevalence of 1:3000 to 1:4000 U.S. infants. If abnormal 
results are found, clinicians should follow recommendations of the 
American College of Medical Genetics ACT Sheets and Algorithm for 
confirmation testing. 
C.  Hyperthyroidism
	1.	 General features:
	
a.	 Epidemiology: Prevalence increases with age, rare before adoles-
cence; female-­to-­male predominance.
	
b.	 Etiology: Most common cause is Graves disease, followed by sub-
acute thyroiditis. Less common causes are Hashitoxicosis, autono-
mously functioning thyroid nodule, factitious hyperthyroidism (intake 
of exogenous hormone), TSH-­secreting pituitary tumor (rare), and 
pituitary resistance to thyroid hormone. See Table 10.9 for compari-
son of Graves and Hashimoto disease.
	
c.	 Laboratory findings: See Table 10.7. Further tests include TSH 
receptor–stimulating antibody, thyroid-­stimulating immunoglobulin 
(TSI), antithyroglobulin and antimicrosomal (thyroid peroxidase) 
antibodies.

	2.	 Thyroid storm21:
	
a.	 Presentation: Acute onset of hyperthermia, tachycardia, and restless-
ness. May progress to delirium, coma, and death.
	
b.	 Treatment: Admission to ICU. Emergent pediatric endocrinology 
consultation recommended. Therapy aimed at relieving symptoms 
(propranolol) and reducing peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 (hydro-
cortisone), thyroid hormone production (antithyroid drugs), release 
of hormone from thyroid gland (potassium iodide), and reabsorption 
from enterohepatic circulation (cholestyramine).
	3.	 Neonatal thyrotoxicosis:
	
a.	 Presentation: Microcephaly, frontal bossing, intrauterine growth restric-
tion (IUGR), tachycardia, systolic hypertension leading to widened 
pulse pressure, irritability, failure to thrive, exophthalmos, goiter, 
flushing, vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and cardiac 
failure or arrhythmias. Onset from immediately after birth to weeks.
	
b.	 Etiology: Occurs exclusively in infants born to mothers with Graves 
disease. Caused by transplacental passage of maternal TSI. 
Occasionally, mothers are unaware they have Graves. Even if a 
mother has received definitive treatment (thyroidectomy or radiation 
therapy), passage of TSI remains possible.
	
c.	 Treatment and monitoring: Propranolol for symptom control. 
Methimazole to lower thyroxine levels. Digoxin may be indicated for 
heart failure. Disease usually resolves by 6 months of age.

	2.	 Increases calcium and magnesium reuptake and phosphorus excretion 
in the kidney
	3.	 Increases 25-­hydroxy vitamin D conversion to 1,25-­dihydroxy vitamin D, 
in order to increase calcium absorption in the intestine

c.	 Secondary AI caused by impaired circulating adrenocorticotropic 
hormone (ACTH) due to hypothalamic or pituitary pathology.
	
d.	 Acquired insufficiency secondary to long-­term corticosteroid use 
leading to HPA suppression. NOTE: This is the most common cause 
seen in clinical practice and may also occur in setting of chronic 
high-dose inhaled corticosteroids.
	 2.	 Laboratory findings in adrenal insufficiency:
	
a.	 In primary AI, there is deficient mineralocorticoid and glucocorti-
coid production. In central AI, there is only deficient glucocorticoid 
production, and mineralocorticoid production is normal.
	
b.	 Primary AI: Elevated ACTH, elevated plasma renin activity, low corti-
sol, low aldosterone, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia.
	
c.	 Central AI: Normal/low ACTH, normal plasma renin activity (no 
impairment of mineralocorticoid function), low cortisol, normal 
aldosterone, hyponatremia, hypoglycemia.
	
d.	 In infants with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), 
17-­hydroxyprogesterone (17-­OHP) is increased (see Table 10.11 for 
normal values by age).
	 3.	 Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency:
	
a.	 Initial screening with AM cortisol level, which may be drawn con-
comitantly with an ACTH level.
	
b.	 See Table 10.12 for interpretation of AM cortisol results.

c.	 Plasma ACTH elevation >100 pg/mL with concomitant hypocorti-
solemia <10 ug/dL is consistent with glucocorticoid deficiency due 
to primary AI.
	
d.	 Standard dose ACTH stimulation test is used to confirm diagnosis.
	 4.	 ACTH stimulation test:
	
a.	 In brief, with ACTH deficiency or prolonged adrenal suppression, 
there is an inadequate rise in cortisol after a single ACTH dose.
	
b.	 See Box 10.1 for interpretation of ACTH stimulation test.
	 5.	 Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH):
	
a.	 See Fig. 10.2.
	
b.	 Group of autosomal recessive disorders characterized by a 
defect in one of the enzymes required in the synthesis of adrenal 
hormones.
	
c.	 The enzymatic defect results in impaired synthesis of adrenal 
steroids beyond the enzymatic block and overproduction of the 
precursors before the block.
	
d.	 21-­hydroxylase deficiency accounts for 90% of cases.
	
e.	 Most common cause of ambiguous genitalia in females.

Interpretation of Results
For evaluation of primary adrenal insufficiency:
<18 mCg/dL: Highly suggestive of adrenal insufficiency
≥18 mCg/dL: Normal (rules out adrenal insufficiency)
For evaluation of central adrenal insufficiency:
<16 mCg/dL: Highly suggestive of adrenal insufficiency
16–30 mCg/dL: Adrenal insufficiency less likely but not excluded
>30 mCg/dL: Normal (rules out adrenal insufficiency)
NOTE: No test for adrenal insufficiency has perfect sensitivity or specificity, so results must be 
interpreted in the individual clinical context. Measurement of serum ACTH is also beneficial 
(elevated in Addison’s, low/normal in secondary insufficiency).

	 6.	 Diagnosis of CAH on newborn screen:
	
a.	 The test measures 17-­OHP and is 2% specific, resulting in a 98% 
false-­positive rate due to artificial elevations from prematurity, sick-
ness, stress.27
	
b.	 If 17-­OHP is 40 to 100 ng/mL, repeat test.
	
c.	 If 17-­OHP is higher than 100 ng/mL, obtain electrolytes and serum 
17-­OHP. If evidence of hyperkalemia or hyponatremia, initiate treat-
ment with hydrocortisone.
	
d.	 In complete enzyme deficiency, adrenal crisis in untreated patients 
occurs at 1 to 2 weeks of age due to salt wasting.
	 7.	 Diagnosis of CAH outside of newborn period:
	
a.	 Suspect partial enzyme deficiency if evidence of androgen excess 
(premature adrenarche, hirsutism, irregular menses, acne, 
advanced bone age).
	
b.	 Morning 17-­OHP levels may be elevated.
	
c.	 Diagnosis may require an ACTH stimulation test. A significant rise 
in the 17-­OHP level 60 minutes after ACTH injection is diagnostic. 
Cortisol response may be decreased.
	 8.	 Addison disease30:
	
a.	 Primary AI due to autoimmune destruction of the adrenal glands.
	
b.	 In children, it may be part of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome 
type 1 (APS-­1), which also includes hypoparathyroidism and 
chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis.
	
c.	 Individuals with autoimmune Addison disease should also be 
screened for other endocrinopathies (T1DM, celiac disease, hypo-
thyroidism, hypoparathyroidism).

	10.	 Stress dosing of steroids:
	
a.	 Hydrocortisone and cortisone are the only glucocorticoids that 
provide the necessary mineralocorticoid effects; prednisone and 
dexamethasone do not.
	
b.	 See Table 10.15 for calculation of moderate and major stress dose 
steroid calculations.
	
c.	 See Box 10.2 for rapid approximation of steroid dosing in the set-
ting of acute adrenal crisis.
	11.	 Indications for stress dosing of steroids:
	
a.	 “Stress” is defined as systemic infection, febrile illness, diarrheal 
illness, trauma/fracture, burns, or surgery.
	
b.	 Stress glucocorticoids should be given to patients:
(1) With known primary or secondary AI
(2) Following discontinuation of exogenous steroid (given for greater 
than 2 weeks at doses greater than physiologic replacement) 
until there is recovery of endogenous cortisol production (con-
sider the need for 8am cortisol or ACTH stimulation test)
	
c.	 Consider for hypotension refractory to fluid resuscitation in patients 
with suspicion for AI (even if not clinically diagnosed). 
B.  Adrenal Cortex Hormone Excess29
	1.	 Causes:
	
a.	 Hypercortisolism (Cushing syndrome):
(1) Exogenous steroid use
(2) Excess cortisol secretion from the adrenals
(3) Excess ACTH production from ectopic ACTH producing tumor
(4) Excess ACTH production from a pituitary tumor (known as 
Cushing disease)

b.	 Hyperaldosteronism:
(1) Benign tumor of adrenal cortex (Conn syndrome)
(2) Overproduction by both adrenal glands (idiopathic 
hyperaldosteronism)
(3) Rarely glucocorticoid remediable aldosteronism
(4) Less common in children than hypercortisolism
(5) Lab findings include hypokalemia and hypernatremia
	2.	 Diagnosis of Cushing Syndrome31:
	
a.	 Step 1: Demonstrate hypercortisolism with two separate measure-
ments. Multiple screening tests are available; specificity increases 
when they are used in combination:
(1) 24-­hour urine cortisol (>90 μg/24 hour consistent with 
hypercortisolism).
(2) Midnight salivary cortisol level (>0.13 mCg/dL consistent with 
hypercortisolism).
(3) Overnight low dose dexamethasone suppression test: Give 1 mg 
dexamethasone at 11pm followed by an 8am serum cortisol the 
next morning (normal suppression <1.8 mCg/dL).
	
b.	 Step 2: Determine etiology of hypercortisolism (ACTH-­dependent vs. 
independent)
(1) Obtain plasma ACTH between 11pm–­1am: >23 pg/mL in a 
patient with hypercortisolism (as diagnosed above) indicates 
ACTH dependency (Cushing Disease vs. ectopic tumor).
(2) If cause is Cushing disease (ACTH-­dependent), ACTH level will 
be >100x elevated.
(3) In ACTH-­independent Cushing syndrome, level will be <5 pg/mL. 
C.  Adrenal Medulla Hormone Excess: Pheochromocytoma32-­34
	1.	 Clinical findings:
	
a.	 Extreme, sustained elevations in blood pressure (accounts for <1% 
of pediatric hypertension).
	
b.	 Associated with syndromes: multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 
IIa and IIb, von Hippel-­Lindau, neurofibromatosis (NF) 1, familial 
paraganglioma syndrome.
	2.	 Diagnosis:
	
a.	 Urine metanephrines (see Table EC 10.A for age-­specific normal values).
	
b.	 Plasma metanephrines (see Table EC 10.B for age-­specific normal 
values).

and sex.
	
b.	 Growth failure is defined as height <2 SD below mid-­parental height 
or height velocity <10th percentile for age resulting in a downward 
trend crossing height percentiles.
	
c.	 Majority of children with short stature are healthy; true growth failure 
is typically pathologic and requires evaluation.
	2.	 Determining etiology:
	
a.	 See Table 10.20 for approach to differentiating between pathologic 
and non-­pathologic causes of short stature.
	
b.	 Bone age is determined by radiographs of left wrist and hand.
	
c.	 See Fig. 10.3 for initial work up.
	
d.	 A more extensive work-­up can be guided by history and physical 
exam and could include:
(1) TTG and IgA (celiac disease)
(2) CBC with differential (anemia, malignancy, inflammation)
(3) CRP/ESR (inflammation, infection)
(4) CMP (renal/liver disorders, malnutrition, calcium disorders)
(5) TSH, free T4 (hypothyroidism)
(6) Karyotype or targeted gene testing (Turner syndrome, SHOX 
mutation)
(7) IGF1, IGFBP-­3 [proxy measurements for growth hormone 
(GH)]; IGFBP-­3 has a higher specificity in children <10); see 
Table 10.21 and Table EC 10.C for normal values of IGF-­1 and 
IGFBP-­3, respectively
	3.	 Indications for growth hormone use38:
The FDA has approved growth hormone for:
	
a.	 Growth hormone deficiency
	
b.	 Children born small-­for-­gestational-­age (SGA) who between 2 and 4 
years of age have shown inadequate catch-­up growth or evidence of 
normal growth velocity with height < 2.5 SD below mean

VII.  SEXUAL DEVELOPMENT39-­45
A.  Puberty
	1.	 For normal pubertal stages, please see Chapter 5.
	2.	 For definitions of precocious and delayed puberty, see Table 10.22. 
B.  Lab Evaluation
	1.	 LH, FSH, estradiol, and testosterone (free and total), see Tables 10.23–10.27 
for normal values. NOTE: Early in puberty, LH production peaks overnight and 
is lower during the day, so consider obtaining levels in the early morning.
	2.	 GnRH stimulation test46:
	
a.	 Purpose: To evaluate for biochemical evidence of puberty when LH, 
FSH, and sex hormone testing is inconclusive.
	
b.	 Method: Give GnRH analog (Leuprolide) SQ, and measure LH and 
FSH levels at 0 and 60 minutes.

254    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	
c.	 Interpretation: Prepubertal children should show no or minimal 
increase in LH and FSH in response to GnRH. A rise of LH to >3.3 to 
5.0 IU/L is evidence of central puberty.
	3.	 Delayed puberty41,45,47: See Fig. 10.4 for information on evaluation and 
management of delayed puberty.
	4.	 Precocious puberty42,47: See Fig. 10.5 for information on evaluation and 
management of precocious puberty. 
C.  Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome48
	1.	 Clinical features in adolescents:
	
a.	 Diagnostic criteria (must have features of both):
(1) Hyperandrogenism: Either clinical or biochemical
	
(a)	 Clinical: Hirsutism, acne, male pattern alopecia
	
(b)	Biochemical characteristics: Elevated androgens including 
DHEA-­S (see Table 10.28 for normal values), free or total 
testosterone
(2) Menstrual abnormalities: Amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea 
(chronic anovulation).
NOTE: Appearance of multiple ovarian cysts is a diagnostic criterion for 
adults, but not for adolescents, as this can be a normal finding in adoles-
cent females.
	
b.	 Common cause of female infertility.
	
c.	 Often LH>FSH, but this is not required for diagnosis.
	
d.	 Chronic anovulation and unopposed estrogen exposure increase risk 
for endometrial cancer.
	
e.	 Associated with insulin resistance and increased risk of type 2 diabetes.
	2.	 Management:
	
a.	 Combined oral contraceptives: First-line for management of men-
strual abnormalities and hirsutism/acne. Increases SHBG (thus 
decreasing free testosterone), which may result in increased insulin 
sensitivity and restoration of ovulation.
	
b.	 Anti-­androgen therapy, such as spironolactone, to treat hirsutism.
	
c.	 Weight reduction and other lifestyle changes.
	
d.	 Metformin: Can be considered as possible treatment if goal is to treat 
insulin resistance. 
D.  Ambiguous Genitalia49
	1.	 Clinical findings in a neonate suspicious for ambiguous genitalia:
	
a.	 Apparent female with clitoromegaly (length >1 cm or width >6 
mm in term infant), inguinal or labial mass, or posterior labial 
fusion.
	
b.	 Micropenis (stretched penile length that is −2.5 SD below mean for 
age, see Table 10.29 for normal values).
	
c.	 Non-­palpable gonads in an apparent male.
	
d.	 Hypospadias associated with separation of scrotal sacs or unde-
scended testis.
	
e.	 Discordance between prenatal karyotype and genital appearance.

	3.	 Evaluation:
	
a.	 Labs: Timing of collection is important.
(1) Initial testing: LH, FSH, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT, 
see Table EC 10.D), anti-­Müllerian hormone (AMH) and expe-
dited determination of sex chromosomes (ask that resulting lab 
rush results of sex chromosomes)
(2) After 36 hours of life: 17-­hydroxyprogesterone
(3) Daily electrolytes until salt-­wasting CAH is ruled out
(4) Further testing as needed to evaluate for more rare forms 
of CAH: DHEA, 17-­hydroxypregnenolone, 11-­deoxycortisol, 
­cortisol, ACTH
	
b.	 Imaging: Options include genitogram (contrast study of the urogenital 
sinus and internal duct structures) or voiding cysto-­urethrogram 
(VCUG), pelvic and abdominal US, and pelvic magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) to evaluate internal anatomy.
	
c.	 Care should be taken to avoid premature gender/sex designation, 
completion of birth certificate, and naming of infant. 
E.  Cryptorchidism50
	1.	 Epidemiology and clinical course:
	
a.	 Can be present at birth (congenital) or after birth (acquired). 
Congenital rate is 1% to 4.6% of males born >2.5 kg.
	
b.	 Increased risk with preterm birth or low birthweight.
	
c.	 About 1/3 to 1/2 of cryptorchid testicles descend spontaneously, usu-
ally by age 3 months.
	
d.	 Neoplasm more common in males with cryptorchidism and may 
occur in contralateral testis; early orchidopexy decreases risk of 
malignancy.
	
e.	 Males with bilateral cryptorchidism have higher risk for reduced 
fertility.
	
f.	 There is a higher risk of testicular torsion prior to repair.
	2.	 Evaluation:
	
a.	 Providers should palpate testes for quality and position in all males at 
each well child visit.
	
b.	 Any phenotypic male newborn with bilateral, nonpalpable testes 
should undergo evaluation for CAH with karyotype and hormonal 
profile.
	
c.	 In those without CAH, distinguish between cryptorchidism and 
anorchia (absent testes) with serum Müllerian inhibiting substance 
and consider additional hormone testing (inhibin B, FSH, LH, and 
testosterone).
	3.	 Treatment: Observe for 6 months, at which time if testis remains unde-
scended, referral to specialist recommended. Orchidopexy between 6 
and 18 months of age recommended.

VIII.  NEONATAL HYPOGLYCEMIA EVALUATION51,52
A.  Definition
	1.	 Serum glucose level insufficient to meet metabolic requirements. For 
practical purposes, value is defined as a point-­of-­care glucose (POCG) 
<45 to 50 mg/dL within first 48 hours of life and <70 mg/dL beyond this 
period.
NOTE: Bedside glucometer is a convenient tool to screen for hypoglycemia 
but can be inaccurate by 10 to 15 mg/dL when in the range of hypo-
glycemia. STAT plasma glucose must be sent to establish diagnosis of 
hypoglycemia. 
B.  Treatment Goals
	1.	 For neonates with suspected congenital hypoglycemia disorder and 
infants/children with confirmed hypoglycemia disorder, maintain plasma 
glucose >70 mg/dL.
	2.	 For high risk neonates without a suspected congenital hypoglycemia 
disorder, maintain plasma glucose >45 to 50 mg/dL for those <48 hours 
of age and >60 mg/dL for those aged >48 hours. 
C.  Management
See Chapter 18. 
D.  Further Work-­up
	1.	 If serum glucose is consistently <70 mg/dL after 48 hours of life, at the 
time of hypoglycemia (serum glucose <45 to 50 mg/dL via glucometer), 
obtain STAT serum glucose, insulin, growth hormone, cortisol, free fatty 
acids, and β-­hydroxybutyrate.
	2.	 Consider glucagon stimulation test: Administer glucagon and obtain 
serum glucose levels Q10 min ×4. Repeat growth hormone and cortisol 
levels 30 minutes after documented hypoglycemia. 
E.  Interpretation of Results
	1.	 A rise in glucose ≥30 mg/dL on glucagon stimulation test, along with 
elevated plasma insulin levels >2 μU/mL (absence of detectable insulin 
does not rule out hyperinsulinism, as insulin may be present below 
the lower limit of detection of the assay), low serum levels of free 
fatty acids (<1.5 mmol/L) and β-­hydroxybutyrate (<2 mmol/L), and a 
persistent glucose requirement >8 mg/kg/min suggests a diagnosis of 
hyperinsulinemia.
	2.	 Hypoglycemia with midline defects and micropenis in a male suggest 
hypopituitarism, supported by low serum levels of growth hormone and 
cortisol at the time of hypoglycemia. 
F.  Hyperinsulinemia
	1.	 Hyperinsulinemia is the most common cause of neonatal hypoglyce-
mia beyond the first 7 days of life and may be congenital or transient.
	2.	 Congenital hyperinsulinism can be caused by dominant or recessive 
mutations in genes responsible for regulating insulin secretion from 
pancreatic β cells.
 

--- Page 354 ---
260    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	3.	 Transient hyperinsulinemia is commonly seen in infants of diabetic 
mothers and less commonly in the setting of perinatal asphyxia and 
intrauterine growth restriction.
	4.	 Long-­term management of persistent hyperinsulinism includes 
diazoxide, which inhibits pancreatic secretion of insulin by keep-
ing β-­cell ATP-­sensitive potassium channels open; however, it has 
been rarely associated with pulmonary hypertension (black box 
warning53).

Fluids and Electrolytes

I.  INTRODUCTION
Intravenous fluids (IVFs) should be thought of as a medication by those who 
prescribe them. Since the late 1950s, IVF choice has been largely guided by 
Holliday and Segar’s estimations of sodium requirements. Using the electrolyte 
composition of human milk, they calculated that the average child requires 3 
mEq sodium (Na) and 2 mEq potassium (K) per 100 to 120 mL water (H2O).1 
According to their calculation, basic solute needs can be met by administer-
ing ¼ normal saline (NS), a hypotonic fluid. While this estimation led to a 
long-­standing tradition in pediatric maintenance IVF (MIVF) therapy, evidence 
published over the past few decades culminated in new American Academy of 
Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines recommending isotonic fluids as the maintenance 
fluid of choice for the majority of hospitalized children.2 
II.  FLUID RESUSCITATION
A.  Calculating Maintenance Fluid Volume
	1.	 The Holliday-­Segar method (Table 11.1 and Box 11.1) is the most 
widely used method to approximate maintenance fluid volume. This 
method estimates caloric expenditure in fixed-­weight categories and 
assumes the average patient will require 100 mL of water for each 100 
calories metabolized, with approximately 100 kcal burned per kg.1
	2.	 NOTE: The Holliday-­Segar method is not suitable for neonates <14 days 
old, because it generally overestimates fluid needs in neonates. (See 
Chapter 18 for neonatal fluid management.) 
B.  Calculating Fluid Loss
	1.	 Total body water (TBW) is equal to 60% of a child’s weight in kg (75% 
in infants).3
	
EQUATION 11.1: TBWa = weight (kg) × 0.6
aTBW uses preillness weight; 1 L water = 1 kg water
	2.	 In a euvolemic child, 60% of TBW resides in the intracellular compart-
ment [where potassium (K) concentration is 140 mEq/L and sodium 
(Na) is negligible], and 40% of TBW is in the extracellular compartment 
(where Na concentration is ∼140 mEq/L and K is negligible).4-­6
	3.	 The most precise method of assessing fluid deficit uses weight loss:
EQUATION 11.2: Fluid deficit (L) = preillness weight (kg) – illness 
weight (kg)

HOLLIDAY-­SEGAR METHOD
Example: Determine the correct fluid rate for an 8-­year-­old child weighing 25 kg:
First 10 kg:
4 mL/kg/hr × 10 kg = 40 mL/hr
100 mL/kg/day × 10 kg = 1000 mL/day
Second 10 kg:
2 mL/kg/hr × 10 kg = 20 mL/hr
50 mL/kg/day × 10 kg = 500 mL/day
Each additional 
1 kg:
1 mL/kg/hr × 5 kg = 5 mL/hr
20 mL/kg/day × 5 kg = 100 mL/day
Answer: 65 mL/hr
Answer: 1600 mL/day

	5.	 In a healthy child, insensible fluid volume loss is approximated as 
⅓ of the Holliday-­Segar MIVF per day. NOTE: This calculation is 
based on fluid requirements of healthy children. Many hospital-
ized children have increased insensible losses (e.g., secondary to 
fever or increased respiratory rate) that must be factored into fluid 
determinations. 
C.  Maintenance Fluid Choice in Hospitalized Children
	1.	 Based on a growing body of evidence, the AAP recommends 
isotonic fluid as the most appropriate MIVF therapy for the vast 
majority of hospitalized children between the ages of 28 days and 
18 years.2 See Table 11.3 for isotonic fluid options.
	2.	 Various disease states can lead to an increased secretion of antidiuretic 
hormone (ADH), which promotes the retention of free water, leading to 
hyponatremia.9,10 See Box 11.2 for examples.
	3.	 Exceptions exist in certain patient populations, such as children with neuro-
surgical disorders, congenital or acquired cardiac disease, hepatic disease, 
cancer, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, nephrotic syndrome, 
diabetes insipidus, and voluminous watery diarrhea or severe burns.2
	4.	 See Table 11.3 and Table 11.4 for electrolyte composition of various 
parenteral and enteral fluid replacement options.
	5.	 Unless hyperkalemia is present or the child is in renal failure, mainte-
nance potassium requirements (20 mEq/L of fluid) should be given.11 
Do not add potassium (K+) to fluids until urine output has been 
established.12,13 
D.  Volume Replacement Strategy7,12,13
	1.	 Volume resuscitation and deficit replacement should generally be com-
pleted over 24 hours.
	2.	 See Table 11.5 for a three-­phase approach to fluid replacement.
	3.	 Children with isonatremic hypovolemia can be repleted with isotonic 
fluid per AAP recommendations.2 See Box 11.3 for sample calculations 
in isonatremic hypovolemia.
	4.	 If ongoing losses can be measured directly, they should be replaced 1:1 
concurrently with maintenance fluid administration. If the losses cannot 
be measured, an estimate of 10 mL/kg body weight for each watery 
stool and 2 mL /kg body weight for each episode of emesis should be 
administered.3 See Table 11.6 for electrolyte composition of certain 
bodily fluids.
	5.	 Oral intake is the preferred method for repletion and maintenance, if 
possible. 
III.  ELECTROLYTE MANAGEMENT
See Chapter 28 for age specific normal values of electrolytes.
A.  Serum Osmolality and Tonicity2,7,14
	1.	 Fluids can be expressed in terms of their tonicity and their osmolality.

	2.	 Serum osmolality (285 to 295 mOsm/kg) is a measure of both permeable 
and nonpermeable solutes and is calculated using the following equation:
EQUATION 11.4:	
	3.	 Osmolality is measured as osmoles per weight (kg) versus osmolarity, 
which is measured as osmoles per volume (L).
	4.	 Tonicity is effective osmolality. It is the net force on water across a semi-
permeable membrane (e.g., the cell membrane) based on the osmotic 
pressures. It is relative and determined largely by sodium content. 
Substances that flow freely across membranes, such as urea, are inef-
fective osmoles and influence osmolality but not tonicity. 
B.  Sodium
The equations within this section are theoretical and are not validated. They 
offer a starting point for calculation of electrolyte abnormalities, but clinical 
context is ALWAYS of the utmost importance and frequent monitoring is 
necessary. Children with neurosurgical disorders, cardiac disease, hepatic 
disease, cancer, kidney disease, diabetes insipidus, and severe burns may 
require consultation with subspecialists before fluid choice and volume is 
administered. When correcting dysnatremias, frequent lab monitoring (∼2 to 
4 hours) is indicated with adjustment of fluid type and rate as needed.

(3)	Witnessed onset of hyponatremia over the course of hours does 
not pose as great of a risk and can be corrected in a similar 
amount of time that it developed.7
(4) If central nervous system (CNS) symptoms are present, hyper-
tonic saline (HTS) should be administered over 3 to 4 hours to 
correct the hyponatremia by ∼5 mEq/L.5,6,11 Use Equation 11.7 
to determine rate of HTS.

	2.	 Hypernatremia: Excess free water loss (Na >145 mEq/L)
	
a.	 Clinical manifestations and differential diagnosis (Table 11.8)
	
b.	 Management
(1) Hypernatremic hypovolemia occurs in scenarios in which free 
water is either unavailable/restricted or there is excessive loss of 
solute-­free water (see Table 11.8).
(2) Hypernatremia is dangerous because of complications from potential 
treatment sequelae, the most serious of which is cerebral edema.4,7
(3) Plan to correct the serum Na by no more than 10 mEq/24 hours 
and correct the free water deficit over 48 hours to minimize the 
risk of cerebral edema.4,10,11,16
(4) As with hyponatremia, witnessed onset of hypernatremia over 
the course of hours can be corrected rapidly; this is because the 
brain has not had time to produce idiogenic osmoles to adapt to 
the change in osmolality.7,11
(5) Expert opinion recommends starting with D5 ½ NS.16 However, 
the sodium and fluid needs can also be calculated.
(6) The free water deficit is as follows:
EQUATION 11.84,6:	
aThe difference in desired and serum Na should be no more than  
10 mEq/L/day

SAMPLE CALCULATIONS: SEVERE HYPERNATREMIC DEHYDRATION
Initial Fluid Resuscitation Strategy to Avoid Rapid Sodium Correction when Serum 
Na+ >175 mEq/L16
Example: A 3-­kg (preillness-­weight) breastfed neonate appearing severely dehydrated with 
serum sodium 185 mEq/L and hemodynamic instability
Resuscitation with normal saline (NS) may drop the serum Na+ too quickly. Plan to simultane-
ously run NS and 3% hypertonic saline (HTS), given rapidly together (i.e., over 5 minutes), 
to effectively give resuscitation fluid with a concentration no more than 15 mEq/L below the 
child’s serum Na+. Repeat the boluses as needed to achieve hemodynamic stability.

Note: In clinical practice, one will often not have laboratory data available quickly enough 
to employ this strategy. However, severe hypernatremia should be suspected in the clinical 
scenario of a solely breastfed neonate who appears severely dehydrated.16 STAT labs should be 
sent, and this strategy may be employed as soon as laboratory values are available.

IV.  ALGORITHM FOR EVALUATING ACID-­BASE DISTURBANCES7,17,18
A.  Determine the pH
The body does not fully compensate for primary acid-­base disorders; there-
fore the primary disturbance will shift the pH away from 7.40.
	1.	 Acidemia (pH < 7.35):
	
a.	 Respiratory acidosis: PCO2 > 45 mm Hg
	
b.	 Metabolic acidosis: Arterial bicarbonate < 20 mmol/L
	2.	 Alkalemia (pH > 7.45):
	
a.	 Respiratory alkalosis: PCO2 < 35 mm Hg
	
b.	 Metabolic alkalosis: Arterial bicarbonate > 28 mmol/L

I.  GASTROINTESTINAL EMERGENCIES
A.  Gastrointestinal Bleeding
	1.	 Presentation: Blood loss from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract occurs in 
four ways: hematemesis, hematochezia, melena, and occult bleeding.
	2.	 Differential diagnosis of GI bleeding: Table 12.1
	3.	 Diagnosis/Management
	
a.	 Assess airway, breathing, circulation, and hemodynamic stability.
	
b.	 Perform full physical exam, verify bleeding with rectal examination, 
and testing of stool or emesis for occult blood. Notable exam findings 
include abdominal tenderness, guarding, rebound, hepatospleno-
megaly, perianal skin tags, or fissures.
	
c.	 Obtain baseline laboratory tests. Complete blood cell count (CBC), 
coagulation studies, type and screen, reticulocyte count, complete meta-
bolic panel (CMP), C-­reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimenta-
tion rate (ESR), and assess for disseminated intravascular coagulation (d 
dimer, fibrinogen).
	
d.	 If concerned for hemodynamic instability, begin initial fluid resuscita-
tion. Consider transfusion if there is continued bleeding, symptomatic 
anemia, and/or a hematocrit level <21%. Initiate intravenous (IV) proton 
pump inhibitor (PPI).
	
e.	 Further evaluation and therapy based on the assessment and site of 
bleeding:
(1) Upper GI Bleeding: Consider esophagogastroduodenoscopy 
(EGD) and testing for Helicobacter pylori.1
(2) Lower GI Bleeding: Consider abdominal radiograph, upper GI 
study (± small bowel follow-­through), air-­contrast barium enema, 
colonoscopy, Meckel scan, tagged red cell scan, computed

history, vaginal/testicular symptoms, urinary symptoms, respiratory 
symptoms, and recent surgeries.
	
b.	 Physical Exam: Rashes, arthritis, and jaundice. Abdominal tender-
ness on palpation, rebound/guarding, rigidity, masses, distention, 
or abnormal bowel sounds, rectal examination with stool hemoccult 
testing, pelvic examination (discharge, masses, adnexal/cervical 
motion tenderness), and genital examinations.
	
c.	 Labs: CBC, CMP, coagulation studies, lactate, type and screen, 
urinalysis, amylase, lipase, gonorrhea/chlamydia testing, β-­human 
chorionic gonadotropin (β-­hCG), ESR, and CRP.
	
d.	 Imaging: Two-­view abdominal radiographs to assess for obstruction, 
constipation, free air, gallstones, and kidney stones. Consider chest 
radiograph to evaluate for pneumonia, abdominal/pelvic ultraso-
nography, and abdominal CT with contrast or magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI).

--- Page 385 ---
286    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	3.	 Diagnosis:
	
a.	 History: Diet, medications, timing (acute vs. chronic), exposures, 
character (bilious, bloody, projectile) and associated symptoms. Pay 
special attention to vomiting without concomitant diarrhea.
	
b.	 Physical Exam: HEENT and neurologic exam with specific attention 
to mucus membranes, skin and dentition, as well as a thorough 
abdominal exam.
	
c.	 Labs: Although not always necessary, consider CMP, CBC, UA, β-­
hCG, and lipase.
	
d.	 Imaging: Plain abdominal radiograph with upright view (to rule out 
obstruction or free air), abdominal ultrasound (US), upper GI series. 
Consider neurologic imaging if indicated.
	4.	 Management: Hydration. Gastric decompression if GI obstruction 
suspected. Antiemetic therapy can be used in the acute setting, avoid 
chronic use (see Chapter 22 for discussion of antiemetic therapy). 
Consider surgical consultation if the vomiting is bilious. 
B.  Gastrointestinal Reflux Disease3
	1.	 Definition: Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is physiologic passage of gas-
tric contents into the esophagus, and gastroesophageal reflux disease 
(GERD) is defined as troublesome symptoms or complications of GER.
	2.	 Differential Diagnosis: Dysmotility including achalasia, gastroparesis, 
ileus, and obstruction. Inflammatory conditions such as esophagitis, 
gastritis/dyspepsia, peptic ulcer disease. Anatomic abnormalities such 
as Zenker diverticulum, tracheoesophageal fistula, vascular ring, pyloric 
stenosis. Functional disorders including abdominal migraines and cycli-
cal vomiting syndrome. Food allergies/intolerance in infants.
	3.	 Diagnosis:
	
a.	 History: Recurrent regurgitation, choking, vomiting, heartburn, chest 
pain, dysphagia, stridor or wheezing, cough, recurrent aspiration 
pneumonia, dental erosions, and sleep disturbances. In infants, 
GERD may present as irritability, weight loss, feeding refusal, or 
Sandifer syndrome. History is typically sufficient for diagnosis and to 
initiate management.
	
b.	 Testing: Esophageal pH monitoring and esophageal impedance 
monitoring if diagnosis unclear.4
	4.	 Management:
	
a.	 Lifestyle: A prone or left-­sided sleeping position and elevation of head 
of bed may improve GER symptoms in older children, but current 
studies for infants have been inconclusive. Infants up to 12 months 
should continue to sleep supine—risk of sleep-­related infant death far 
outweighs benefit of prone or lateral sleeping in GERD. After feeds, 
infants should be kept upright and a trial of smaller more frequent 
feeds may be beneficial. Avoidance of second-­hand smoke exposure.
	
b.	 Diet: Milk-­thickening agents can be beneficial for symptom relief. 
If severe and unresponsive to conservative management, consider 
2-­ to 4-­week trial of extensively hydrolyzed protein formula in infants 
 

--- Page 386 ---
Chapter 12  Gastroenterology    287

or elimination of cow’s milk in maternal diet to eliminate milk protein 
sensitivity as a cause of unexplained vomiting.
	
c.	 Pharmacotherapy: Medication is not recommended for “happy spit-
ters” or infants with uncomplicated GER. Both PPIs and H2 receptor 
antagonists (H2RAs) are effective in relieving symptoms and promot-
ing mucosal healing.5 There is insufficient evidence to support rou-
tine use of prokinetic therapies (metoclopramide and erythromycin). 
C.  Eosinophilic Esophagitis6,7
	1.	 Definition: A chronic, immune/antigen-mediated disease characterized 
by symptoms of esophageal dysfunction with ≥15 eosinophils/high-
power field (hpf) on esophageal biopsy.
	2.	 Diagnosis:
	
a.	 History: Dysphagia, food impaction, chest pain, food refusal or 
intolerance, GER symptoms, emesis, abdominal pain, and failure to 
thrive. Majority of patients with EoE have concurrent atopic disorder.
	
b.	 Diagnosis: EGD with esophageal biopsies demonstrating at least 15 
eos/hpf histoligically with chronic symptoms of esophageal dysfunction; 
Must evaluate for other causes or contributions to esophageal eosino-
philia. Importantly histologic evidence without clinical correlation is not 
diagnostic. Per the AGREE conference, a PPI trial is no longer needed 
for diagnosis. Consider obtaining allergy testing (see Chapter 15).
	3.	 Management8:
	
a.	 Dietary therapy: 6-food elimination diet (milk, wheat, eggs, soy, pea-
nuts/tree nuts, seafood), elemental diet, or targeted elimination diet 
determined by allergy testing.
	
b.	 Pharmacotherapy: Topical swallowed steroids delivered via inhaler are 
preferred as first line therapy to induce remission with limited side 
effects (6- to 8-week course of fluticasone or budesonide metered-
dose inhaler administered orally without a spacer). PPI therapy can 
also be trialed for initial treatment. Systemic steroids for short-term 
use (e.g., dysphagia leading to dehydration or weight loss). No cur-
rent evidence to support routine use of biologics.
	
c.	 Complications: Symptomatic strictures requiring esophageal dilation. 
D.  Celiac Disease9
	1.	 Definition: An immune-­mediated inflammatory enteropathy caused by 
sensitivity to dietary gluten and related proteins (wheat, barley, and rye) 
in genetically susceptible individuals.
	2.	 Diagnosis:
	
a.	 History: Presentation can be variable, and some patients are asymptom-
atic. Most common symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal 
pain, constipation, distention, and failure to thrive. Non-­GI symptoms 
include rash (dermatitis herpetiformis), osteoporosis, short stature, 
delayed puberty, and iron deficiency anemia that is resistant to oral iron. 
Increased occurrence in children with autoimmune disorders, Down 
syndrome, Turner syndrome, William syndrome, immunoglobulin A (IgA) 
deficiency, and in first-­degree relatives of those with celiac disease.
 

--- Page 387 ---
288    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	
b.	 Labs: First line screening is IgA antibody to human recombinant 
tissue transglutaminase (TTG) and serum IgA. If known selective IgA 
deficiency with symptoms suggestive of celiac disease, testing with 
TTG IgG is recommended. CBC, iron studies, hepatic function panel, 
thyroid tests, calcium, and vitamin D are recommended. Additional 
antibody testing may be necessary for inconclusive clinical scenarios.
	
c.	 Procedures: Biopsy is “gold standard” for diagnosis. Intestinal biop-
sies showing villous atrophy supports diagnosis. Results dependent 
on adequate consumption of gluten prior to testing; ensure 6 to 8 
weeks of gluten ingestion prior to endoscopy.
	3.	 Management: Lifetime, gluten-­free diet. Annual screening with TTG is 
recommended to monitor adherence to diet.
	4.	 Complications: More often seen in adulthood but at risk for vitamin defi-
ciencies and other autoimmune disorders. Higher risk of non-­Hodgkin 
lymphoma, specifically enteropathy associated T-­cell lymphoma. 
E.  Inflammatory Bowel Disease (EoE)10,11
	1.	 Classification:
	
a.	 Crohn disease: Transmural inflammatory process affecting any 
segment of the GI tract, most commonly terminal ileum. Commonly 
presents with abdominal pain, weight loss, diarrhea, and poor 
growth.
	
b.	 Ulcerative colitis (UC): Chronic, relapsing, inflammatory disease of 
the colon and rectum. Commonly presents with rectal bleeding and 
diarrhea.
	2.	 Diagnosis:
	
a.	 History: Abdominal pain, weight loss, diarrhea, lethargy, nausea, 
vomiting, malnutrition, psychiatric symptoms, arthropathy, and 
rashes. Family history, exposure to infectious agents, or antibiotic 
treatment.
	
b.	 Physical Exam: Stomatitis, perianal skin tags, fissures, and 
fistulas. Assessment of hydration and nutritional status. Fever, 
orthostasis, tachycardia, abdominal tenderness, distention, 
or masses suggests moderate to severe disease and need for 
hospitalization.
	
c.	 Labs: CBC, CMP, ESR, CRP. Fecal calprotectin has been shown to 
be elevated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and may serve as 
a sensitive, noninvasive test.12 IBD often associated with anemia, 
hypoalbuminemia, thrombocytosis, and elevated inflammatory mark-
ers. Stool studies to exclude infectious process are necessary.
	
d.	 Imaging: MRE is the preferred imaging modality for diagnosis of 
pediatric IBD due to high diagnostic accuracy and no radiation 
exposure. CT and fluoroscopy are other alternative strategies if MRE 
unavailable.
	
e.	 Procedures: Diagnostic endoscopy with biopsies used to confirm 
diagnosis.

	3.	 Management13-­16:
	
a.	 Induction of remission:
(1) Crohn: Exclusive enteral formula-­based nutrition (80%–100% 
caloric need by liquid formula), 5-­aminosalicylates, antitumor 
necrosis factor (TNF) agents, and, if indicated, antibiotics or 
surgery. Corticosteroids can be used if necessary.
(2) UC: Corticosteroids, 5-­aminosalicylates, TNF agents, and if indi-
cated, antibiotics or surgery. Therapy guided by severity of illness.
	
b.	 Maintenance of remission: Immunosuppression includes thiopurines, 
methotrexate, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and anti-­TNF monoclonal 
antibodies. Avoid prolonged steroid use.
	
c.	 Other: Surgical intervention indicated only after medical management 
has failed in both Crohn’s disease and UC. In Crohn disease, surgery 
is indicated for localized disease (strictures), abscess, or disease 
refractory to medical management. 
F.  Constipation17
Normal stooling patterns by age: Infants 0 to 3 months, 2 to 3 bowel move-
ments/day (breastfed infants may stool after every feed or go 5 to 7 days 
with no stool); 6 to 12 months, 1.8/day; 1 to 3 years, 1.4/day; >3 years, 1/
day. If an exclusively breastfed <1 month old is not stooling regularly, it may 
be a sign of insufficient milk intake; monitor weight gain.
	1.	 Definitions:
	
a.	 Constipation: Delay or difficulty in defecation for 2 or more weeks. 
Functional causes of constipation are the most common. History and 
physical exam are often sufficient for diagnosis.
(1) Functional: Consider Rome IV Criteria (Table EC 12.A)
(2) Nonfunctional: See Table 12.4 for differential diagnosis.
	2.	 Diagnosis:
	
a.	 History: Age of onset, toilet training experience, frequency/consis-
tency/size of stools, pain or bleeding with defecation, presence of 
abdominal pain, soiling of underwear, stool-­withholding behavior, 
change in appetite, abdominal distention, allergies, dietary history, 
medications, developmental history, psychosocial history. Refer to 
Bristol Stool Form Scale for classification of stool history (Fig. 12.1. 
Delayed meconium, poor weight gain or weight loss, anorexia, 
nausea, vomiting, and family history (e.g., thyroid disorders, cystic 
fibrosis) would warrant further evaluation for nonfunctional causes.
	
b.	 Physical Exam: External perineum, perianal examination. Fecal 
impaction may be palpated on abdominal or digital rectal examina-
tion. Plain abdominal single view radiography can be considered 
when physical examination is unreliable.
	3.	 Management of functional constipation: Box 12.1 and Table EC 12.B.
	
a.	 Disimpaction:
(1) Oral/Nasogastric Approach: Polyethylene glycol (PEG) solutions 
are effective for initial disimpaction. May also use other osmotic 
laxatives.

MANAGEMENT OF CONSTIPATION
HOME CLEANOUT INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1: Take a stimulant laxative (bisacodyl, senna) with 8 oz of liquid, as per dosing instructions 
below. This should be done 6 hr prior to intended effect.
Step 2: Drink polyethylene glycol (PEG). Mix with water or another clear noncarbonated liquid. Drink 
full amount in 2 hr. See below for dosing instructions.
Step 3: 1–2 hr after finishing PEG, should begin passing formed/thick brown stool. The stool should 
become thinner and clearer stooling continues.
Step 4: If not stooling or passing very thick stools 4 hr after the PEG is finished, drink 1 capful of 
PEG in 8 oz of liquid every hour until stools are clear.
Step 5: Cleanout is finished when stool is mostly clear with very little sand-­like material mixed in. 
Proceed to maintenance instructions below.

DAILY MAINTENANCE THERAPY
The day after colon cleanse, the patient should begin taking maintenance daily PEG for continued 
management of constipation.
Advise patient/family to mix PEG in clear noncarbonated drink or water at least once daily. See 
formulary for dosing. Advise to drink the entire solution in 30 min or less for it to work well. It is 
best to give the PEG after school and before dinner. Do not give PEG right before bedtime.
The goal of daily maintenance PEG is for the child to have 1 or 2 soft and easily passable bowel 
movements every day.
Advise to have child to sit on the toilet after every meal or whenever they feel the need to stool.
aSee Formulary for dosing recommendations.

292    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
(2) Rectal approach: Saline or mineral oil enemas effective. Avoid 
enemas in infants, glycerin suppositories may be used in infants 
less than 1 year.
	
b.	 Maintenance therapy (usually 3 to 12 months): Goal is to prevent 
recurrence.
(1) Dietary changes: Evidence supporting dietary intervention is 
weak; however, increased intake of fruits, vegetables, whole 
grains, and fluids other than milk is recommended.
(2) Behavioral modifications: Regular toilet habits with positive rein-
forcement. Referral to a mental health specialist for motivational 
or behavioral concerns if soiling an issue.
	(3) Medications: Daily PEG. Lactulose as second line treatment. The 
use of stimulant laxatives and stool softeners may also be con-
sidered. Avoid prolonged use of stimulant laxatives. Discontinue 
therapy gradually only after return of regular bowel movements 
with good evacuation. Evidence does not support use of probiotics.
	
c.	 Special considerations in infants aged <1 year: 2 to 4 oz of 100% 
fruit juice (e.g., prune or pear) recommended in younger infants. 
Glycerin suppositories may be useful. While use is off label, PEG is 
routinely used in children <1 year of age. Avoid mineral oil, stimulant 
laxatives, and phosphate enemas. 
G.  Diarrhea18
	1.	 Definition: Acute diarrhea is more than three loose or watery stools per 
day. Chronic diarrhea is diarrhea lasting more than 2 to 4 weeks.
	2.	 Pathogenesis: It can be infectious or malabsorptive with an osmotic or 
secretory mechanism.
	
a.	 Osmotic diarrhea: Water is drawn into intestinal lumen by maldi-
gested osmotic compounds, as seen in celiac disease, pancreatic 
disease, or lactose intolerance. Stool volume depends on diet and 
decreases with fasting (stool osmolar gap ≥100 mOsm/kg).
	
b.	 Secretory diarrhea: Water accompanies secreted or unabsorbed elec-
trolytes into the intestinal lumen (e.g., excessive secretion of chloride 
ions caused by cholera toxin). Stool volume is increased and does 
not vary with diet (stool osmolar gap <50 mOsm/kg).
	
c.	 Stool osmolar gap: The standard value is 290 mOsm/kg.19
	
Stool osmolar gap =
Stool Osm − {2× [stool (Na) mEq/L + stool (K) mEq/L]}
	
	3.	 Differential Diagnosis: Table 12.5
	4.	 Diagnosis:
	
a.	 History: acute vs. chronic, travel history, recent antibiotic use, and 
immune status.
	
b.	 Labs: CMP, CBC, stool hemoccult testing, stool culture, C. difficile 
toxin, ova and parasites, and viral antigens (see Chapter 17 for com-
mon bacterial and viral pathogens).

12
	5.	 Management
	
a.	 Oral rehydration therapy (ORT)20: Enteral hydration has proven 
superior in reducing the length of hospital stay and adverse events.21 
Parenteral hydration is indicated in severe dehydration, hemody-
namic instability, or failure of ORT.
	
b.	 Diet: Restart regular diet as soon as tolerated.
	
c.	 Pharmacotherapy: No supporting evidence for use of nonspecific 
antidiarrheal agents, antimotility agents (e.g., loperamide), antise-
cretory drugs, and toxin binders (e.g., cholestyramine). Consider 
evidence-­based antimicrobial therapy for infectious diarrhea (see 
Chapter 17). If malabsorptive (e.g., celiac disease or IBD), therapy 
should be tailored to disease process.
	
d.	 Probiotics22: Evidence supporting use of probiotics is limited; 
however, their efficacy has been demonstrated in the following cir-
cumstances: antibiotic-­associated diarrhea, mild to moderate acute 
diarrhea, C. difficile diarrhea (severe recurrent disease only), hepatic 
encephalopathy, the prevention of atopic dermatitis, and possibly 
preventing necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants.23

	2.	 Liver cell injury: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotrans-
ferase (ALT), and lactate dehydrogenase.
	3.	 Biliary system: bilirubin (total and direct), urobilinogen, γ-­
glutamyltransferase, and alkaline phosphatase. 
B.  Acute Liver Failure24,25
	1.	 Definition: Laboratory evidence of liver injury with no known history of 
chronic liver disease, the presence of coagulopathy not corrected by 
vitamin K administration, and an INR >1.5 if patient has encephalopa-
thy or >2.0 if patient does not have encephalopathy.
	2.	 Differential Diagnosis: Table 12.7
	3.	 Diagnosis:
	
a.	 History: Fatigue, nausea, vomiting, irritability, confusion, drowsiness, 
skin changes, medications, ingestion, illicit drug use, family history, 
developmental delay, transfusion history.
	
b.	 Physical Exam: Neurologic status, skin exam, hepatosplenomegaly, 
nutritional status, growth, bruising, petechiae. Slit lamp exam if 
concern for Wilson disease. Findings of chronic liver disease include 
clubbing, palmar erythema, cutaneous xanthoma, ascites, and 
prominent abdominal vessels.
	
c.	 Labs: Liver synthetic/metabolic function, liver cell injury, and biliary 
system tests (see earlier). BMP, magnesium, phosphorus, CBC with 
peripheral smear, reticulocyte count, ammonia, lipase. Factors V, 
VII (depleted first in ALF), VIII, and fibrinogen. A urine toxicology 
screen and a serum acetaminophen level should be obtained (see 
Chapter 3). Viral hepatitis studies, autoantibodies, and evaluation for 
metabolic syndromes must be considered. 
NOTE: See Chapter 17 for interpretation of serologic markers of 
hepatitis B.

d.	 Imaging: Abdominal US with Doppler flow. Consider head CT scan to 
exclude hemorrhage/edema, and chest radiography.
	
e.	 Procedures: Liver biopsy
	
f.	 Management: Evaluate for underlying cause. Consider intensive care 
unit (ICU) level care with close monitoring of mental status, fluid 
balance, metabolic disturbances, hepatorenal syndrome, sepsis, and 
coagulopathies. Cerebral edema is life-­threatening and may require 
intracranial pressure monitoring. Consider liver transplant when 
indicated. 
C.  Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease26
	1.	 Definition: Chronic liver disease from excessive fat accumulation in the 
liver, often secondary to insulin resistance and obesity. Most common 
liver disease in children in the United States.
	2.	 Diagnosis: Screen between 9 and 11 years for obese children and 
overweight children with risk factors. ALT is the recommended test. If 
ALT persistently elevated >2 times upper limit of normal for >3 months, 
further evaluation is warranted. Must exclude alternative etiologies.
	3.	 Management: Extensive lifestyle modifications, well-­balanced healthy 
diet. No medications have proven benefit. Bariatric surgery can be con-
sidered if severe comorbidities. Screen for diabetes and other comorbid 
conditions. 
D.  Hyperbilirubinemia27-­29
	1.	 Definition: Bilirubin is the product of hemoglobin metabolism. There 
are two forms: direct (conjugated) and indirect (unconjugated). 
Hyperbilirubinemia is usually the result of increased hemoglobin load, 
reduced hepatic uptake, reduced hepatic conjugation, or decreased 
excretion. Direct hyperbilirubinemia is defined as a direct bilirubin 
>20% of the total bilirubin or a direct bilirubin of >2 mg/dL.
	2.	 Differential Diagnosis: Table 12.8
	3.	 Management: Dependent upon etiology. Evaluation and diagnosis should 
be guided by history; however, liver laboratory studies (see earlier) and 
USs are warranted in many patients. Refer to Chapter 18 for evaluation 
and treatment of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. 
IV.  PANCREATITIS30-­32
Definition: Inflammatory disease of the pancreas.
A.  Acute Pancreatitis33
	1.	 Diagnosis:
	
a.	 History: Abdominal pain, irritability, epigastric tenderness, nausea 
and vomiting. Multiple etiologies (Table 12.9). Per INSPPIRE criteria, 
diagnosis of acute pancreatitis requires at least two of the following:
(1) Abdominal pain compatible with acute pancreatitis
(2) Serum amylase and/or lipase values >3 times upper limit of normal
(3) Imaging findings consistent with acute pancreatitis
 

--- Page 398 ---
Chapter 12  Gastroenterology    297
12
	
b.	 Labs: CMP, GGT, CBC, amylase, lipase, calcium, and triglycerides.
	
c.	 Imaging: Transabdominal US recommended. CT or MRI reserved for 
more complicated cases depending on etiology.
	2.	 Management:
	
a.	 Analgesia: Acetaminophen or NSAIDs as first line therapy; opiates for 
refractory pain.
	
b.	 Nutrition: Aggressive IV fluid hydration within initial 48 hours. Early 
enteral feeding recommended (within 72 hours of presentation and 
hemodynamically stable) and associated with shorter hospitalization 
and decreases comorbidity.

 See additional content on Expert Consult
I.  METABOLISM1-­7
A.  Clinical Presentation of Metabolic Disease (Box 13.1)
	1.	 Metabolic disease can be conceptualized into broad categories (Table 13.1).
	2.	 When considering a particular diagnosis, a complete patient history, 
including details of conception, pregnancy, prenatal screening and 
diagnostic studies, delivery, postnatal growth, development, and a three-­
generation family history in the form of a pedigree (Fig. EC 13.A) should 
accompany a comprehensive physical examination. The family history 
may be remarkable for close relatives who died of similar presentations 
(may be mistaken for “sepsis” or “SIDS”).
	3.	 A high index of suspicion is required, as routine investigations may be 
unrevealing.
	4.	 Routine newborn screening (see Section II) is meant to detect many 
metabolic disorders before onset of clinical symptoms, but the condi-
tions tested for vary by state and not all countries test, so clinical suspi-
cion should remain high if clinical picture is concerning. 
B.  Evaluation
	1.	 Initial laboratory tests: Comprehensive metabolic panel, blood glucose, 
venous blood gas (VBG), ammonia (beware false-­positives from tour-
niquets, struggling children, or sample delay), lactate, creatine kinase 
(CK), complete blood cell count with differential, urine ketones.
	2.	 Subsequent evaluation for metabolic disease:
	
a.	 Consult a geneticist.
	
b.	 A basic metabolic work-­up includes plasma amino acids (PAA), urine 
organic acids (UOA), acylcarnitine profile, quantitative (free and 
total) plasma carnitine, lactate/pyruvate ratio. Further specialized 
biochemical testing is available.
	3.	 Additional labs given specific circumstances:
	
a.	 Metabolic acidosis: Ammonia, lactate, b-­hydroxybutyrate, acetoace-
tate, UOA, urinalysis with urine pH, acylcarnitine profile, quantitative 
(free and total) plasma carnitine (Fig. 13.1).
	
b.	 Hyperammonemia: VBG, UOA, PAA, acylcarnitine profile, urine orotic 
acid (Fig. 13.2).

BROAD CLASSIFICATION OF METABOLIC DISEASE1-­6
Intoxication disorders
Toxic accumulation of small molecules upstream of a defective enzyme. 
Tend to present early in life with nonspecific symptoms that may 
include recurrent vomiting, irritability, lethargy progressing to coma, 
organ dysfunction. Symptoms may wax and wane with intercurrent 
illness.

Disorders of reduced fasting tolerance
Disorders in the body’s ability to tolerate fasting, with early onset of 
hypoglycemia. Can present in infancy or later when trying to sleep 
through the night, including morning symptoms or seizures. Look for 
laboratory abnormalities and symptoms not usually found in typical 
fasting.
Table 13.3
Hypoglycemia algo-
rithm Fig. 13.4
Disorders of complex molecules
These disorders have a broad phenotypic spectrum and typical 
biochemical screening can be unrevealing. Features can be present 
at birth and/or slowly progressive affecting multiple organ systems. 
Often enzymatic and/or broad molecular genetic testing is needed.
Table 13.4
Mitochondrial disorders
Defect in energy production through the electron transport chain. There 
is a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, often involving high-­
energy organs including brain, muscle, and/or heart.

Neurotransmitter disorders
Defect in neurotransmission which can present around birth with 
severe infantile epileptic encephalopathy, or later with parkinsonism-
dystonia, neruodevelopmental or psychiatric disorders.

	2.	 A general guiding principal is to provide hydration and enough glucose 
to meet the patient’s caloric needs to stop catabolism.
	
a.	 Use D10% + electrolytes for age at 1.5 to 2 times maintenance rate.
	
b.	 Use caution in mitochondrial disorders (and do not use D10 in  
pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency), because this may enhance lactic 
acidosis. If uncertain, measure lactate and acid-­base status regularly.
	3.	 For unknown/suspected metabolic disease, treatment should not be 
delayed during work-­up.

c.	 The dose of arginine HCl is 200 to 600 mg/kg, depending on the 
diagnosis.
(1) 200 mg/kg for carbamylphosphate synthase (CPS) deficiency 
and ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency.
(2) 600 mg/kg for citrullinemia and argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) 
deficiency.
	
d.	 Administer as a loading dose over 90 to 120 minutes, followed by 
an equivalent dose as a maintenance infusion over 24 hours.
	3.	 Arginine HCl for MELAS stroke-­like episode: bolus of 0.5 g/kg given 
within 3 hours of symptom onset, followed by an additional 0.5 g/kg 
administered as a continuous infusion for 24 hours for the next 3 to 
5 days.9 (MELAS: mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, 
stroke-­like episodes)
	4.	 Sodium benzoate for nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH): start with 500 
mg/kg/day added to a 24-­hour supply of formula or divided at least 4 
times daily and consult a biochemical geneticist.10 
II.  NEWBORN METABOLIC SCREENING7
A.  Timing
	1.	 First screen should be performed within the first 48 to 72 hours of life 
(at least 24 hours after initiation of feeding).
	2.	 Second screen (requested in some states) should be performed after 7 
days of age.
	3.	 Preterm infants: Perform initial screen at birth (to collect sample 
before transfusions), another at age 48 to 72 hours, a third at age 7 
days, and a final at age 28 days or before discharge (whichever comes 
first). 
B.  Abnormal Result
	1.	 Requires immediate follow-­up and confirmatory testing; consult a 
geneticist.
	2.	 ACT Sheets and Confirmatory Algorithms are available for more informa-
tion on how to proceed with specific abnormalities: https://www.acmg.
net/ACMG/Medical-Genetics-Practice-Resources/ACT_Sheets_and_

A.  History
Pertinent history includes pregnancy course, prenatal exposures, type of 
conception (natural or assisted), perinatal history, developmental mile-
stones, and review of systems. 
B.  Family History
	1.	 Three-­generation pedigree focused on both medical and developmental 
histories (see Fig. EC 13.A).
	2.	 Helpful mnemonics include:
	
a.	 SIDE mnemonic15: Anything SIMILAR in the family? Anything 
INHERITED through the family? Any premature, unexplained 
DEATHS? Any EXTRAORDINARY events?
	
b.	 SCREEN mnemonic16: SOME CONCERNS about conditions running 
in the family? REPRODUCTION—any issues with pregnancy infertil-
ity, or birth defects? EARLY disease, death, or disability? ETHNICITY? 
NONGENETIC—any other risk factors?
	
c.	 Rule of Too/Two13:
	
(1) 	Too: tall? short? many? few? early? young? different?
	
(2) 	Two: cancers? generations? in the family? birth defects?
	3.	 Patterns of inheritance: See Online Content for discussion of different 
patterns of inheritance. 
C.  Physical Examination
	1.	 Major anomalies: Structural anomalies that are found in less than 5% of 
the population and may cause significant cosmetic or functional impair-
ment, often requiring medical or surgical management.
	2.	 Minor anomalies11,12,14,17: Structural anomalies that are found in greater 
than 5% of the population with little or no cosmetic or functional signifi-
cance to the patient.
	3.	 Examples of major and minor anomalies (Table 13.7). Three or more 
minor anomalies may be a nonspecific indicator of occult or major 
anomaly. 
D.  Work-­up
	1.	 Imaging to evaluate for major anomalies
	
a.	 Head ultrasound (US) or brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
	
b.	 Echocardiogram
	
c.	 Complete abdominal US
	
d.	 Skeletal survey with radiographs composed of: AP views of skull, 
chest/ribs, upper extremities and hands, lower extremities and feet; 
lateral views of skull, complete spine, chest, and odontoid view.
	2.	 Dilated eye exam
	3.	 Hearing evaluation
	4.	 Genetic testing: See Fig. 13.4 and Table 13.8. The patient should be 
referred to genetics for a dysmorphology evaluation and appropriate 
testing.

	5.	 Examples: Autosomal dominant inheritance seen in Van der Woude syn-
drome (associated with lip pits) and Stickler syndrome (can have retinal 
detachment, hearing loss). 
D.  Connective Tissue Disorders
	1.	 Consider when a patient has velvety skin, hyperextensible joints, 
abnormal scarring, poor healing, striae, pectus deformities, tall stature, 
myopia, lens dislocations, arachnodactyly.
	2.	 Evaluation: Some connective tissue disorders are associated with dilated 
aorta (echocardiogram), dysplastic vessels, or fragility of lens/retina 
(ophthalmology evaluation).
	3.	 Examples: Dilated aorta with characteristic physical features in Marfan 
syndrome; vascular fragility in vascular Ehlers-­Danlos (type IV); isolated 
hyperextensibility of joints in hypermobile Ehlers-­Danlos (type III). 
E.  Developmental Delay, Intellectual Disability
	1.	 All children should be offered genetic evaluation.
	2.	 See Chapter 9 for information on evaluation.
	3.	 Examples: Microarray is first tier test because it can detect micro-
deletion and microduplication syndromes, such as 1p36 deletion 
syndrome. FMR1 repeat testing can detect fragile X syndrome and 
heterozygous females, who can also have developmental delays. 
Further testing may be indicated to detect monogenic causes, such as 
Kleefstra syndrome.

13
F.  Deafness, Hard of Hearing
	1.	 Approximately 60% of hearing loss is genetic. It can be syndromic or 
nonsyndromic.
	2.	 Consider perinatal infectious causes (e.g., cytomegalovirus).
	3.	 Evaluation: Consider connexin 26 and 30 gene testing as first step if 
nonsyndromic and/or broad gene panel testing. Individualize inner ear/
brain imaging. Ophthalmology assessment, ECG, and renal US should 
be done for those with negative connexin testing.
	4.	 Examples: Approximately half of nonsyndromic hearing loss is from 
GJB2 (encodes connexin 26) gene mutations. Syndromic causes 
include Usher syndrome, which can also have gradual blindness. 
G.  Hypotonia
	1.	 Central: Abnormalities of brain function, normal strength or axial weakness, 
preserved/persistent newborn reflexes, normal CK, normal muscle bulk.
	
a.	 Evaluation: CK to differentiate. Evaluate for causes such as hypothy-
roidism (TSH); evaluate brain structure and function with MRI and 
EEG.
	
b.	 Examples: Beckwith-­Wiedemann syndrome, Prader-­Willi syndrome, 
peroxisomal disorders.
	2.	 Peripheral: Alert, profound weakness that is often appendicular, absent 
reflexes, feeding difficulties, normal or increased CK.
	
a.	 Evaluation: Evaluate for causes such as hypothyroidism (TSH) or 
mitochondrial disease (lactate/pyruvate). Electromyography (EMG) to 
determine if muscle or nerve affected. Consider that cardiac muscle 
could be affected (echocardiogram).
	
b.	 Examples: Spinal muscular atrophy, myotonic dystrophy, muscular 
dystrophies. 
H.  Limb and Stature Disorders
	1.	 Can be defects in collagen formation, bone formation, or remodeling.
	2.	 Evaluation: Radiographic skeletal survey of all bones to localize dyspla-
sia. Some disorders, including achondroplasia, can have narrowing at 
the foramen magnum or cervical instability (flexion/extension C-­spine 
films). There can be a risk of central or peripheral sleep apneas (sleep 
study). Karyotype for females with short stature to evaluate for Turner 
syndrome. Unless a specific disorder suspected, broad genetic testing 
is appropriate.
	3.	 Examples: Rhizomelic limb shortening and narrow foramen magnum 
seen in achondroplasia. Cervical instability seen in COL2A1 gene muta-
tions (spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, Stickler syndrome). The 
presence of multiple congenital joint contractures is called arthro-
gryposis, which is seen in many disorders. Fractures can be seen in 
osteogenesis imperfecta and hypophosphatasia. 
I.  Liver Disease
	1.	 Liver failure and/or direct and indirect hyperbilirubinemia can be 
a manifestation of a metabolic disorder or the result of a genetic 
syndrome.
 

--- Page 422 ---
318    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	2.	 Evaluation: Metabolic work-­up including PAA, UOA, urine succinylac-
etone, very-­long-­chain fatty acids, urine reducing substances. Some 
syndromes have ocular features (ophthalmology evaluation). Unless a 
specific disorder suspected, broad genetic testing is appropriate.
	3.	 Examples: Cholestasis found in progressive familial intrahepatic cho-
lestasis (type 1, 2, and 3). Liver dysfunction can be seen in tyrosinemia. 
Indirect/unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia can be seen in Gilbert and 
Crigler-­Najjar syndromes. 
J.  Oncologic Disorders19
	1.	 Approximately 9% of pediatric oncology patients have a heritable cancer 
predisposition syndrome or germline mutation. This puts them and 
affected family members at risk for certain cancers and may affect their 
individualized treatments.
	2.	 Obtain a thorough family history with specific cancer diagnoses and age 
of diagnosis.
	3.	 Evaluation: Many cancers warrant referral. Genetic testing is tailored to 
each specific diagnosis. Examples include myelodysplastic syndrome, 
medulloblastoma, atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor, sarcomas, pituitary 
blastoma, and many more.
	4.	 Examples: Early onset of cancers in Li-­Fraumeni syndrome (espe-
cially sarcoma) and von Hippel-­Lindau syndrome (especially 
hemangioblastoma). 
K.  Overgrowth
	1.	 Generalized overgrowth can result in macrosomia at birth or height and/
or head circumference greater than the 98th percentile.
	2.	 Hemihypertrophy of a limb may be the result of mosaicism from somatic 
changes.
	3.	 Be aware that certain overgrowth syndromes have associated cancer 
risks and may require routine monitoring (e.g., abdominal US screening 
in Beckwith-­Wiedemann syndrome).
	4.	 Evaluation: Disorder-­specific genetic testing based on exam findings; 
may require skin biopsy. In some disorders, internal organs can be 
affected (echocardiogram, ECG, renal US).
	5.	 Examples: Generalized overgrowth with developmental delays can be the 
result of Sotos syndrome, Beckwith-­Wiedemann syndrome, or others. 
Segmental overgrowth/hemihypertrophy can result from somatic PIK3CA 
mutations affecting the brain (MCAP syndrome) or a limb (Klippel-­
Trénaunay syndrome). 
L.  Seizure Disorders
	1.	 Consider genetics especially with positive family history, intractable 
epilepsy, infantile onset, developmental regression, intellectual disability, 
dysmorphic features, autism, or brain malformations.
	2.	 Can be the result of metabolic conditions or syndromic disorders.
	3.	 Increased recurrence risk in families even if no genetic cause identified.
	4.	 Evaluation: Consideration of microarray, epilepsy panels, or whole 
exome sequencing (particularly if dysmorphic features present); 
 

--- Page 423 ---
Chapter 13  Genetics: Metabolism and Dysmorphology    319
13
consider biochemical testing for inborn errors of metabolism; physical 
exam with Wood’s lamp for cutaneous manifestations (e.g., hypopig-
mented macules).
	5.	 Examples: Sodium channel defects (SCN1A mutations) can lead to a 
broad spectrum of seizures. Accompanying dermatologic findings can 
be characteristic for neurocutaneous disorders, including neurofibroma-
tosis type 1 and tuberous sclerosis. 
M.  Skin Pigmentation Alterations
	1.	 Can be the result of post-­zygotic mosaicism. As a result, genetic variants 
may only be detectable in affected skin and not in blood.
	2.	 Skin and the central nervous system are derived from the same neural 
crest lineage; many skin pigmentation anomalies have associated cen-
tral nervous system abnormalities, including malformations or seizures. 
Often referred to as neurocutaneous disorders.
	3.	 Evaluation: Examination with a Wood’s lamp, ophthalmology evaluation
	4.	 Examples: Multiple café-­au-­lait macules seen in neurofibromatosis 
type 1 and Legius syndrome. Genetic mosaicism in skin can lead to a 
pigmentation pattern called hypomelanosis of Ito. 
N.  Vascular Anomalies
	1.	 Can involve arterial, vascular, and lymphatic systems. Can be caused by 
germline mutations or postzygotic somatic changes (mosaicism). Some 
are associated with segmental overgrowth.
	2.	 Vascular syndromes can cause clinically significant arteriovenous mal-
formations and arteriovenous fistulas in the skin, internal organs, and 
brain/spine.
	3.	 Evaluation: Examine mucosal membranes. Some disorders require 
evaluation for intraorganal arteriovenous malformations with abdominal 
US and/or MRI/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of brain and 
spine. Several disorders are autosomal dominant—obtain family history 
for vascular lesions.
	4.	 Examples: Autosomal dominant history of multiple capillary malforma-
tions could be from RASA1 mutations. Port-­wine stains seen in Sturge-­
Weber syndrome. Telangiectasias on lips, nose, and hands seen in 
hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. 
V.  ETIOLOGIES OF DYSMORPHIC FEATURES (FIG. 13.5)11,14,29
A.  Aneuploidy
Abnormal number of chromosomes.
	1.	 Aneuploidy syndromes are most commonly due to maternal nondisjunc-
tion and more rarely due to chromosomal translocation or mosaicism. 
Risk increases with maternal age.
	2.	 The evaluation for aneuploidy often begins prenatally with a first trimes-
ter screen (nuchal translucency, nasal bone, free β-­human chorionic 
gonadotropin [β-­hCG], PAPP-­A) or circulating cell-­free fetal DNA analy-
sis showing increased risk.
 

--- Page 424 ---
320    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	3.	 Prenatal diagnostic testing options include chorionic villus sampling in 
the first trimester or amniocentesis during or after the second trimester.
	4.	 Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) may be performed in the first 
24 to 48 hours of life to indicate number of chromosomes but will not 
determine the morphology of the chromosomes (e.g., if a translocation 
is present). Therefore karyotype analysis is still indicated in aneuploidy 
syndromes, both to provide a diagnosis and to provide accurate genetic 
counseling.
	5.	 Specific aneuploidy syndromes:
	
a.	 Down syndrome (Trisomy 21):
	
(1)	 Features: Hypotonia and characteristic facial features (brachy-
cephaly, epicanthal folds, flat nasal bridge, upward-­slanting pal-
pebral fissures, Brushfield spots, small mouth and ears), excess 
skin at the nape of the neck, single transverse palmar crease, 
short fifth finger with clinodactyly, wide gap between the first and 
second toes. Intellectual disability present in all, but severity is 
variable.
	
(2)	 Full health supervision guidelines from the American Academy of 
Pediatrics (AAP) are available (see Section VII).
	
(3)	 In brief: In addition to karyotype, neonates should have echocar-
diogram to assess for congenital heart disease, ophthalmologic 
evaluation to assess for cataracts, hearing screen, complete blood 
count (CBC) to assess for transient myeloproliferative disease, 
thyroid studies to assess for hypothyroidism, and referral to early 
intervention services. Annual thyroid studies, CBC (add ferritin 
and CRP for any child at risk of iron deficiency), hearing and 
vision assessments. Cervical spine x-ray at age 3 years if asymp-
tomatic (sooner imaging with immediate neurosurgical referral if 
symptomatic). Monitor for signs of obstructive sleep apnea and 
neurologic dysfunction.
	
b.	 Edwards syndrome (Trisomy 18):
	
(1)	 Features: Intrauterine growth restriction and polyhydramnios, 
small for gestational age at birth, clenched hands with overlap-
ping fingers, hypoplastic nails, short sternum, prominent occiput, 
low-­set and structurally abnormal ears, micrognathia, rocker-­
bottom feet, congenital heart disease, cystic and horseshoe 
kidneys, seizures, hypertonia, significant developmental and 
cognitive impairments.
	
(2)	 Ninety percent die before 1 year of life.
	
c.	 Patau syndrome (Trisomy 13):
	
(1)	 Features: Defects of forebrain development (holoprosencephaly), 
severe developmental disability, low-­set malformed ears, cleft lip 
and palate (CLP), microphthalmia, aplasia cutis congenita, poly-
dactyly (most frequently of the postaxial type), narrow hypercon-
vex nails, apneic spells, cryptorchidism, congenital heart defects.
	
(2)	 Ninety-­five percent die before 6 months of life.
 

--- Page 425 ---
Chapter 13  Genetics: Metabolism and Dysmorphology    321
13
	
d.	 Turner syndrome (45, X):
	
(1)	 Features: Short stature, gonadal dysgenesis with amenorrhea and 
lack of a pubertal growth spurt, broad chest with hypoplastic or 
inverted nipples, webbed neck. The diagnosis should be consid-
ered prenatally in a female fetus with hydrops, increased nuchal 
translucency, cystic hygroma, or lymphedema. Intelligence is 
usually normal, but patients are at risk for cognitive, behavioral, 
and social disabilities.
	
(2)	 Full health supervision guidelines from the AAP are available (see 
Section VII).
	
(3)	 In brief: Obtain baseline echocardiogram, renal US, ophthalmol-
ogy and audiology evaluations. Routine thyroid testing, biochemi-
cal liver tests, HgbA1C, vitamin D, TTG and immunoglobulin A 
(IgA), audiology, skin examinations, bone mineral density, and 
skeletal assessments.
	
e.	 Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY; 48, XXYY; 48, XXXY; and 49, XXXXY):
	
(1)	 Features: Primary hypogonadism, which may present in infancy 
with hypospadias or cryptorchidism or in adolescence/adulthood 
with infertility, gynecomastia, and small testes. Children may have 
expressive language delay.
	
(2)	 There is an increased risk of breast carcinoma in 47, XXY.
	
(3)	 Testosterone therapy is indicated at puberty for hypergonado-
tropic hypogonadism. 
B.  Copy Number Variation (Deletions and Duplications)
Partial loss or additional copies of genetic material on part of a 
chromosome.
	1.	 22q11 Deletion syndrome (Velocardiofacial syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome)
	
a.	 Features: Congenital heart disease (tetralogy of Fallot, interrupted 
aortic arch, ventricular septal defect [VSD], and truncus arteriosus 
most common), palatal abnormalities (velopharyngeal incompetence, 
cleft palate), characteristic facial features in approximately two-­
thirds, developmental delays, learning disabilities, immunodeficiency, 
hypocalcemia, feeding problems, renal anomalies, hearing loss, 
laryngotracheoesophageal anomalies, growth hormone deficiency, 
autoimmune disorders, seizures (with or without hypocalcemia), and 
psychiatric disorders.
	
b.	 Diagnostic evaluation: Microarray; FISH is no longer recommended. 
Assessments should include serum calcium, absolute lymphocyte 
count, B-­ and T-­cell subsets, renal US, chest x-­ray, cardiac examina-
tion, and echocardiogram.
	
c.	 Health supervision: Health supervision recommendations have been 
published. Hold live vaccines until immune function is assessed.
	2.	 5p− Syndrome (Cri-­du-­chat syndrome)
	
a.	 Features: High pitched cry, delayed development, intellectual dis-
ability, microcephaly, low birth weight, hypotonia, hypertelorism, low 
 

--- Page 426 ---
322    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
set ears, small jaw, round face, congenital heart disease (VSD, atrial 
septal defect [ASD], PDA).
	
b.	 Diagnostic evaluation: Can be detected on karyotype or microarray.
	3.	 1p36 Deletion syndrome
	
a.	 Features: Developmental delay, intellectual disability, delayed growth, 
hypotonia, seizures, speech delay, hearing and vision impairment, 
microcephaly, low ears with thick helices, congenital heart disease 
(structural defects or cardiomyopathy).
	
b.	 Diagnostic evaluation: Microarray. 
C.  Disorders of Methylation/Epigenetics
Heritable changes that affect gene activity and expression.
	1.	 Prader-­Willi syndrome
	
a.	 Features: Severe hypotonia and feeding difficulties in infancy, fol-
lowed by an insatiable appetite in later infancy or early childhood. 
Developmental delays in motor and language abilities. All affected 
individuals have some degree of intellectual disability. Short stature 
is common; males and females have hypogonadism, and in most, 
infertility.
	
b.	 Diagnostic evaluation: Results from missing paternally contributed 
region. Methylation testing can detect almost all individuals—whether 
due to abnormal paternal-­specific imprinting, a paternal deletion, or 
maternal uniparental disomy within the Prader-­Willi/Angelman critical 
region of 15q. Follow-­up with further molecular testing.
	
c.	 Health supervision: Full health supervision guidelines from the 
AAP are available (see Section VII). Monitor for feeding difficul-
ties in infancy and close supervision beginning in childhood to 
prevent obesity. Evaluate for and treat hypothyroidism, sleep 
apnea (central and obstructive), central adrenal insufficiency,21 
and cryptorchidism.
	
d.	 Treatment: Growth hormone can be beneficial, and hormone replace-
ment therapy can aid in sexual development.
	2.	 Angelman syndrome
	
a.	 Features: Happy demeanor, hand-­flapping, and fascination with 
water. Severe developmental delay, intellectual disability, severe 
speech impairment, gait ataxia, tremulous limbs, hypotonia, micro-
cephaly, and seizures.
	
b.	 Diagnostic evaluation: Results from missing maternally contributed 
region. Methylation testing can detect almost all individuals—whether 
due to abnormal maternal-­specific imprinting, a maternal deletion, or 
paternal uniparental disomy within the Prader-­Willi/Angelman critical 
region of 15q. Some individuals can be detected through UBE3A 
sequence analysis.
	
c.	 Health supervision: Monitor for seizures, behavior problems, feeding 
issues, sleep disturbance, scoliosis, strabismus, constipation, and 
gastroesophageal reflux disease.
 

--- Page 427 ---
Chapter 13  Genetics: Metabolism and Dysmorphology    323
13
	
d.	 Treatment: Antiepileptic drugs for seizures; be careful not to over-
treat, because Angelman syndrome also associated with movement 
abnormalities (avoid carbamazepine, vigabatrin, and tiagabine).22 
Speech therapy with a focus on nonverbal communication. Sedatives 
for nighttime wakefulness.
	3.	 Classic Rett syndrome: X-­linked disease present only in females because 
pathogenic MECP2 variants are most often lethal in males who have 
only one X chromosome. Males who do survive with MECP2 mutations 
have presentation different from Rett syndrome that often incudes 
neonatal encephalopathy.
	
a.	 Features: Neurodevelopmental syndrome that presents after 6 to 18 
months of typical development with acquired microcephaly, then 
developmental stagnation, followed by rapid regression. Gait ataxia 
or inability to ambulate, repetitive, stereotypical handwringing, fits of 
screaming or inconsolable crying, episodic breathing abnormalities 
(sighing, apnea, or hyperpnea), tremors, and generalized tonic-­clonic 
seizures.
	
b.	 Diagnostic evaluation: Molecular testing of MECP2.
	
c.	 Health Supervision: Regular ECG to evaluate QT interval,23 monitor 
for scoliosis. 
D.  Repeat Expansion
Pathogenic expansion of trinucleotide repeats during DNA replication.
	1.	 Fragile X syndrome
	
a.	 Most common cause of inherited intellectual disability.
	
b.	 Features: Males have relative macrocephaly and prominent ears. 
Postpubertal macroorchidism and tall stature that slows in ado-
lescence. Females have a range of intellectual disability due to 
the degree of X inactivation of the affected chromosome. Female 
premutation carriers (55 to 200 repeats) can develop primary ovarian 
insufficiency; males with 55 to 200 repeats can have a tremor/ataxia 
phenotype.
	
c.	 Diagnostic evaluation: Repeat expansion testing of FMR1 gene to 
assess number of CGG trinucleotide repeats (typically >200 in fragile 
X syndrome).
	
d.	 Health supervision: Full health supervision guidelines from the AAP 
are available (see Section VII). Symptom and supportive psychophar-
macologic medications.
	2.	 Other examples include Huntington disease (CAG repeats), myotonic 
dystrophy (CTG repeats), and Friedrich ataxia (GAA repeats). 
E.  Mendelian/Single Gene Disorders
Mutation in a single gene causing a disorder.
	1.	 Marfan syndrome
	
a.	 Features: Myopia, ectopia lentis, aortic dilatation with predisposition 
to rupture, mitral valve prolapse, pneumothorax, bone overgrowth 
and joint laxity, pectus carinatum or excavatum, scoliosis, pes 
planus.
 

--- Page 428 ---
324    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	
b.	 Diagnostic evaluation: Clinical diagnosis based on the revised Ghent 
criteria (a “systemic score” system based on clinical features that can 
support a diagnosis if score is greater than or equal to 7). Molecular 
genetic testing of FBN1 gene.
	
c.	 Health supervision: Annual ophthalmologic examination; annual echo-
cardiography; intermittent surveillance of the entire aorta with computed 
tomography (CT) or MRA scans beginning in young adulthood. Avoid 
contact sports, competitive sports, isometric exercise. Full health super-
vision guidelines from the AAP are available (see Section VII).
	
d.	 Treatment: β-­blocker (atenolol) and/or an angiotensin-­II type 1 recep-
tor blocker (losartan) is current standard of care. Valve-­sparing sur-
gery to replace aortic root when diameter exceeds ∼4.5 cm in adults 
(or if rates of aortic dilation exceed ∼0.5 cm/year) and significant 
aortic regurgitation is present.24
	2.	 Ehlers-­Danlos syndrome (EDS)
	
a.	 Features: Smooth, velvety, hyperextensible skin, widened scars, poor 
healing, easy bruising, joint hypermobility with recurrent dislocations, 
chronic joint or limb pain, and a positive family history. The vascular-­
type EDS is distinct and involves translucent skin, characteristic 
facies (pinched nose), as well as risk for arterial, intestinal, and 
uterine fragility or rupture.
	
b.	 Diagnostic evaluation: Clinical evaluation and family history. For clas-
sical and vascular types, echocardiogram and DNA testing. Vascular 
type additionally needs MRI/MRA imaging of aorta and iliac arteries. 
Joint hypermobility can be scored with Beighton criteria. No known 
genetic cause of hypermobile type.
	
c.	 Treatment: Physical therapy to improve joint stability, low-­resistance 
exercise, and pain medications as needed; treat gastroesophageal 
reflux. Vascular EDS requires management in a clinic specializing in 
connective tissue disorders.
	3.	 Achondroplasia
	
a.	 Features: Short arms and legs (especially rhizomelia); bowing of the 
lower legs; large head with characteristic facial features including frontal 
bossing and midface retrusion. Infantile hypotonia is typical, followed 
by delayed motor development. Gibbus deformity of the thoracolumbar 
spine leads to exaggerated lumbar lordosis. Rarely, children have hydro-
cephalus and restrictive pulmonary disease. Stenosis at the foramen 
magnum in infancy increases the risk of death; lumbar spinal stenosis 
may present in childhood but is more common in adulthood. Intelligence 
and lifespan are usually normal. Average adult height for males and 
females is approximately 4 feet.
	
b.	 Diagnostic evaluation: Clinical diagnosis based on characteristic physi-
cal exam. FGFR3 mutation testing available if diagnostic uncertainty.
	
c.	 Health supervision: Full health supervision guidelines from the AAP 
are available (see Section VII). In brief: Use standard growth charts 
for achondroplasia. Baseline head CT including cervicomedullary 
junction in infancy, and precautions against uncontrolled head

movement or neck manipulation. Monitor for signs of obstructive 
sleep apnea, middle ear complications (e.g., otitis media), or spinal 
stenosis (more common in adults). 
F.  Teratogen Exposure (Table 13.10)
G. In utero Forces25
	1.	 Uterine compression:

VI.  CONSENT AND DISCLOSURE OF GENETIC TESTING
A.  Ethics of Genetic Testing in Pediatrics
Genetic testing in pediatric patients poses unique challenges given that chil-
dren require proxies (most often parents) to give consent for testing. Several 
publications and statements have been made with regard to genetic testing 
in children, including the “Ethical Issues with Genetic Testing in Pediatrics” 
statement made by the AAP.26 Important considerations include:
	1.	 Testing and screening of a pediatric patient should be in his/her best 
interest and provide clear benefits.
	2.	 If testing is performed for the interests of parents or other family mem-
bers, it should not be to the detriment of the child.
	3.	 Treatment and/or follow-­up must be available after testing is sent.
	4.	 Carrier testing or screening in children and adolescents is not broadly 
supported.
	5.	 Predictive testing for late-­onset disorders is discouraged until a patient 
is able to make an autonomous decision; in these cases, extensive pre-­
test counseling is recommended. 
B.  Informed Consent
Pretest counseling and informed consent are important prior to sending any 
genome-­wide testing and documentation of informed consent is recom-
mended. Possible results from genetic testing include:
	1.	 Positive—a causative/related variant is found.
	2.	 Negative—either no causative/related variant is present, or the avail-
able technology or scope of the test methodology was unable to detect 
the causative/related variant. A negative result does not guarantee the 
condition does not have a genetic etiology.
	3.	 Variant(s) of uncertain significance—variants for which the meaning is 
uncertain (could be variants without clinical significance or related to 
the patient’s presentation but not previously reported).
	4.	 Incidental finding(s)—variants anticipated to affect the patient’s health 
that are unrelated to the indication for sending the test (and may be an 
adult-­onset condition).
	5.	 Discovery that parents are blood relatives and/or nonmaternity/nonpaternity. 
C.  Professional Disclosure of Familial Genetic Information
Pretest counseling should include the discussion that genetic testing may 
have implications for family members. With regard to disclosure of genetic 
testing results to at-­risk family members when a patient or family member 
chooses not to disclose, the provider must weigh the duty to respect privacy 
and autonomy of the patient with the duty to prevent harm in another 
identifiable person. The ethical and legal duties of the physician are not well

Chapter 13  Genetics: Metabolism and Dysmorphology    327
13
defined. The American Society of Human Genetics released a statement 
on professional disclosure of familial genetic information which outlines 
“exceptional circumstances,” which if all are present, disclosure may be 
permissible: (1) attempts to encourage disclosure by the patient have failed, 
(2) harm is “highly likely” to occur, (3) the harm is “serious and foreseeable,” 
(4) either the disease is preventable/treatable, or early monitoring will reduce 
risks, (5) the at-­risk relative(s) are identifiable, and (6) the harm of failure to 
disclose outweighs the harm that may result from disclosure. 27
D.  Disclosure of Incidental Findings
Patients are sometimes given the option to be informed of any incidental or 
secondary findings when they pursue genetic testing, but in general, it is rec-
ommended that incidental findings should be reported when there is strong 
evidence of benefit to the patient. The minimal list of reportable incidental 
findings may be found in the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) 
March 2013 statement and related updates. 28

VIII.  ONLINE CONTENT
A.  Patterns of Inheritance
	1.	 Autosomal dominant:
	
a.	 Disease manifestation with a variant in one allele of a gene; the other 
allele is normal.
	
b.	 It can appear in multiple generations.
	
c.	 An affected individual has a 50% risk of passing on the variant with 
each pregnancy.
	2.	 Autosomal recessive:
	
a.	 Disease manifestation requiring variants in both alleles of the gene.
	
b.	 There can be multiple affected individuals in the same generation.
	
c.	 An affected couple (each being a carrier) has a 25% chance of hav-
ing an affected child, a 25% chance of having an unaffected child, 
and a 50% chance of producing a carrier of the condition with each 
pregnancy.
	3.	 X-­linked:
	
a.	 Because females have two X chromosomes and males have only one 
X chromosome, males are more commonly and more severely affected 
by X-­linked conditions. Females can be unaffected or have a spectrum 
of manifestations. In carrier females, lyonization is the process of 
silencing one X chromosome in each cell and “unfavorable lionization” 
can result in a large proportion of cells that inactivated the normal X 
chromosome, and as a result clinical features are present.
	
b.	 Females have a 50% chance of passing on an affected X to each 
male or female child. Males will pass on the affected X to all female 
children and will have unaffected sons.
	4.	 Mitochondrial:
	
a.	 Classically a matrilineal inheritance pattern, caused by mitochondrial 
DNA inherited from one’s mother that contributes to mitochondrial 
function. Sons will be affected but cannot pass the condition on to 
their offspring.
	
b.	 There may be significant phenotypic variability due to “hetero-
plasmy,” in which the relative proportion of affected and unaffected 
mitochondria may change as cells divide.
	
c.	 Mitochondrial disease is currently known to be caused by either vari-
ants in mitochondrial DNA or by recessive variants in nuclear genes 
that code for proteins that function in the mitochondria.
	5.	 Genomic imprinting and uniparental disomy:
	
a.	 The two alleles of a gene may be functionally equivalent but may 
be expressed or silenced depending on the parent of origin of the 
chromosome. This is due to the presence of epigenetic machinery 
influencing the expression of genes and resulting in different meth-
ylation patterns.
	
b.	 Uniparental disomy is a rare occurance in which offspring have 
inherited both copies of a chromosome from one parent. There are 
two types: (1) Uniparental isodisomy is an error in meiosis II, in 
 

--- Page 433 ---
327.e2    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
which the offspring receives two identical copies of a chromosome 
from one parent. This can result in autosomal recessive disorders 
because any variant on one parental allele could be present on both 
alleles of their offspring. (2) Uniparental heterodisomy is an error 
in meiosis I, in which the offspring receives both copies of a single 
parent’s chromosome. This can result in disorders of imprinting 
because only one parent contributed to the epigenetic pattern of that 
chromosome.

I.  ANEMIA
A.  Screening for Anemia
	1.	 The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends screening 
between 9 and 12 months with a repeat level in 6 months.
	2.	 Screen yearly in high-­risk children: history of prematurity or low birth 
weight, exposure to lead, exclusive breastfeeding without supplemental 
iron beyond 4 months, diet without iron-­fortified cereals or foods natu-
rally rich in iron, feeding problems, poor growth, inadequate nutrition.1 
B.  Definition of Anemia
	1.	 Anemia is defined as a reduction in hemoglobin (Hb) two standard 
deviations below the mean, based on age-­specific norms.
	2.	 See Table 14.1 at the end of the chapter for age-­specific blood cell indices. 
C.  Causes of Anemia
	1.	 See Fig. 14.1 for approach to anemia based on red blood cell (RBC) pro-
duction, as measured by reticulocyte count and cell size. Note that normal 
ranges for Hb and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) are age-­dependent.
	2.	 See Tables 14.2 and 14.3 for more details regarding specific causes of 
nonhemolytic and hemolytic anemia. 
D.  Evaluation of Anemia
	1.	 Useful equations in the evaluation of anemia:
	
a.	 Mentzer index2 = MCV/RBC
	
(1)	 Index >13 suggests iron deficiency anemia (IDA).
	
(2)	 Index <13 suggests thalassemia trait.
	
(3)	 Sensitivity: 62% for IDA, 86% for beta thalassemia trait. 
Specificity: 86% for IDA, 62% for thalassemia.
	
b.	 Reticulocyte index = % reticulocytes × patient hematocrit/normal hematocrit3
	
(1)	 >2 is indicative of increased RBC production in appropriate 
response to anemia.
	
(2)	 <2 is evidence of hypoproliferative anemia.
	2.	 Other useful indices and tests
	
a.	 RBC distribution width (RDW):
	
(1)	 Normal in thalassemia.
	
(2)	 Increased in IDA and sideroblastic anemia.
	
b.	 Mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC): Hb/hematocrit (Hct):
	
(1)	 Allows for classification of anemia as hypochromic, normochro-
mic, or hyperchromic.

Secondary autoimmune hemolytic 
anemia
Causes: Infections,a drug-­associated,b malignancy (Hodgkin 
lymphoma), systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune lym-
phoproliferative syndrome, common variable immunodeficiency, 
posttransplant (stem cell or solid organ).
Transfusion reactions (ABO or Rh 
incompatibility)
See Table 14.18 for presentation of transfusion reactions.
INTRINSIC HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA
Membrane Disorders
Neonatal hemolytic disease
Maternal antibodies to incompatible fetal RBC antigens (Rh, A, B) 
causes hemolytic disease in utero and in neonatal period.
Diagnosis: Mild anemia to hydrops fetalis, early jaundice.
Treatment: Intensive phototherapy, exchange transfusion.
Hereditary spherocytosis
Inheritance: 75% AD. 25% spontaneous mutation or AR.
Protein defect → membrane instability → RBC destruction via 
extravascular hemolysis.
Diagnosis: Family history with clinical suspicion and spherocytes 
on smear, osmotic fragility test, EMA flow cytometry if unclear 
clinical picture.
Treatment: Folate supplementation if moderate-­severe hemolysis, 
anticipatory guidance, splenectomy (for severe disease), 
­cholecystectomy if needed for symptomatic cholelithiasis.
Hereditary elliptocytosis
Inheritance: Typically AD.
Diagnosis: Elliptocytes on smear.
Treatment: Same as for hereditary spherocytosis.
Enzyme Deficiencies
G6PD deficiency
Inheritance: X-­linked disorder.
Enzyme deficiency predisposes to intravascular hemolysis with 
oxidative stress (e.g., with infections/illness, fava beans, 
medications).
Diagnosis: G6PD assay when well (may be falsely elevated immedi-
ately after hemolytic episode).
Treatment: Avoid oxidative triggers (see drug/chemical list), 
transfuse for severe anemia.
Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency
Inheritance: AR disorder of PKLR or PKM genes causes chronic 
hemolysis.
Diagnosis: Measure PK activity in RBC.
Treatment: Transfuse if symptomatic. Consider splenectomy if 
severe transfusion-­dependent anemia.
aInfections include EBV, CMV, mycoplasma, pneumococcus, parvovirus.

sickle cell disease during childhood.
FAC
HbC and adult normal HbA present, consistent with benign HbC trait.
FSA
Heterozygous HbS/β+-­thalassemia, a clinically significant sickling disorder.
Fa
Fetal HbF is present without adult normal HbA. May indicate delayed appearance of 
HbA, but is also consistent with homozygous β-­thalassemia major or homozygous 
hereditary persistence of fetal HbF.

336    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
 E.  Management of Anemia
	1.	 Iron deficiency anemia
	
a.	 Oral iron (ferrous sulfate)
	
(1)	 Empirically treat children with microcytic anemia and history of 
poor dietary iron.5
	
(2)	 In anemia of chronic disease, only use iron supplementation if 
evidence of absolute iron deficiency and ferritin <100 ng/mL.5
	
(3)	 After initiation of iron supplementation, expect reticulocyte count 
to increase within the first week with a 1 g/dL increase in Hb in 4 
weeks (if severe anemia with Hb <9 g/dL, a response should be 
seen in 2 weeks).1
	
b.	 Iron transfusion (low molecular weight iron dextran6 or iron sucrose7) 
is appropriate for children with iron malabsorption (PPI use, short 
bowel syndrome, primary malabsorption), poor response to oral 
iron therapy, inability to tolerate oral iron therapy, and hemodialysis-­
dependent patients receiving erythropoietin.
	2.	 Sickle cell anemia
	
a.	 Etiology: Caused by a genetic defect in β-­globin that leads to polymer-
ization and sickling with deoxygenation, leading to hemolysis, adher-
ence to blood vessel endothelium, and vaso-­occlusive ischemia.
	
b.	 Most common subtypes: HbSS (sickle cell anemia) and HbSβ0 
(sickle-­β0-­thalassemia) are most severe. HbSC (sickle-­hemoglobin C 
disease) and HbSβ+ (sickle-­β+-­thalassemia) are often milder.
	
c.	 Diagnosis: Often made on newborn screen with Hb electrophoresis. The 
sickle preparation and Sickledex are rapid tests that are positive in all 
sickle hemoglobinopathies. False-­negative test results may be seen in 
neonates and other patients with a high percentage of fetal Hb.
	
d.	 Complications: See Table 14.5. A hematologist should be consulted.
	
e.	 Acute management of anemia in sickle cell disease8:
	
(1)	 RBC exchange transfusions: Indicated for patients with symp-
tomatic severe acute chest syndrome (ACS), stroke, intractable 
pain crisis, intrahepatic cholestasis, hepatic sequestration, 
refractory priapism, and multisystem organ failure. Also indi-
cated for children with prior stroke or transcranial Doppler read-
ing >200 cm/sec.8 Replace with HbS-­negative cells. Follow Hct 
carefully with goal Hct <30% to avoid hyperviscosity.9
	
(2)	 Do not transfuse for asymptomatic anemia, acute kidney injury, 
or recurrent splenic sequestration.
	
f.	 Chronic management and health maintenance8: See Table 14.6. 
Ongoing consultation and clinical involvement with a pediatric hema-
tologist and/or sickle cell program are essential.
	3.	 Thalassemia
	
a.	 Etiology: Defects in α-­ or β-­globin production leads to precipitation 
of excess chains, causing ineffective erythropoiesis and shortened 
survival of mature RBCs.

b.	 α-­Thalassemia:
	
(1)	 Silent carriers (α−/αα): Not anemic; Hb electrophoresis usually 
normal.
	
(2)	 α-­Thalassemia trait (α−/α−) or (αα/−): Causes mild microcytic 
anemia from birth; Hb electrophoresis usually normal. Hb Barts 
can be seen in infancy (e.g., on state newborn screens) in 
patients with α-­thalassemia trait.
	
(3)	 HbH disease (β4) (α−/−−): Causes moderately severe anemia 
from birth; HbH (β-­tetramer) may be seen on newborn screen 
and subsequent electrophoresis.
	
(4)	 Hb Bart/hydrops fetalis (−−/−−): Hb Barts (γ4) cannot deliver 
oxygen; usually fatal in utero or in neonatal period.
	
c.	 β-­Thalassemia: Ineffective erythropoiesis is more severe in β-­thalassemia 
than α-­thalassemia. Patients often develop more severe iron overload 
from increased enteral absorption and transfusions. Adult Hb electropho-
resis with decreased Hb A, increased Hb A2, and increased Hb F.
	
(1)	 Thalassemia trait/thalassemia minor (β/β+) or (β/β0): Mildly 
decreased β-­globin production. Usually asymptomatic with mild 
anemia.
	
(2)	 Thalassemia intermedia (β+/β+): Markedly decreased β-­globin 
production. Presents at about 2 years of age with moderate com-
pensated anemia (Hb 7 to 10 g/dL). Wide variability in presenta-
tion that may include features noted as follows.
	
(3)	 Thalassemia major/Cooley anemia (β0/β0, β+/β0, or β+/β+): 
Minimal to no β-­globin production. Presence of anemia within first 
6 months of life requiring regular transfusions. Overstimulation of 
bone marrow, ineffective erythropoiesis, and iron overload results 
in jaundice, growth failure, hypersplenism, gallstones, skeletal 
abnormalities, liver cirrhosis, and cardiac impairment.
	
d.	 Management10
	
(1)	 Patients with thalassemia major are transfusion dependent. 
Patients with thalassemia intermedia may need occasional 
transfusions.
	
(2)	 Transfuse every 3 to 5 weeks for goal pretransfusion Hb 9 to 
10.5 mg/dL.
	
(3)	 Goal posttransfusion Hb <14 to 15 g/dL due to risk of hypervis-
cosity and stroke.
	
(4)	 Treat iron overload with chelation (deferoxamine), which should 
be initiated in thalassemia major after 10 to 20 transfusions or 
when ferritin >1000 μg/L.
	
(5)	 Bone marrow transplant is curative. 
II.  NEUTROPENIA
A.  Definition of Neutropenia
	1.	 Neutropenia is defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 
<1500/μL. Severe neutropenia is defined as an ANC <500/μL.
 

--- Page 452 ---
Chapter 14  Hematology    341
14
	2.	 See Table 14.7 at the end of the chapter for age-­specific leukocyte differentials.
	3.	 Repeat CBC 2 to 3 weeks later to determine if transient (e.g., secondary 
to a medication, infection) or persistent.11 
B.  Causes and Evaluation of Neutropenia11
	1.	 CBC +/− blood smear should be obtained to evaluate neutrophil mor-
phology and concurrent presence of anemia or thrombocytopenia.
	2.	 If pancytopenic, obtain bone marrow aspiration and biopsy with 
cytogenetics.
	3.	 If persistent neutropenia for more than 2 to 4 weeks, consider further 
workup based on potential etiologies (Table 14.8). 
C.  Management of Neutropenia
	1.	 Additional diagnostic testing:12
	
a.	 Repeat CBC 2×/week for 6 to 8 weeks for cyclic neutropenia.
	
b.	 Reticulocyte Index to differentiate between destructive processes and 
marrow failure.
	
c.	 Blood smear for morphologic abnormalities.
	
d.	 Immunologic testing (Coombs test, anti-­double-­stranded DNA, anti-
neutrophil antibody) for autoimmune or alloimmune processes.
	
e.	 IgG, IgA, IgM, lymphocyte subtypes for immunodeficiency.
	2.	 Treatment:
	
a.	 Myeloid-­specific cytokine granulocyte colony-­stimulating factor  
(G-­CSF; filgrastim).
	
(1)	 Indications for continuous use: Severe congenital neutropenia, cyclic 
neutropenia, glycogen storage disease 1b, bone marrow failure (e.g., 
aplastic anemia, Schwachman Diamond-­Oski syndrome).12,13
	
(2)	 Indications for intermittent use: Life-­threatening infection or history 
of recurrent or serious infections in patients with neutropenia.12
	
(3)	 Side effects: Bone pain, headache, rashes.
	
b.	 Stem cell transplant: Indicated for bone marrow failure (e.g., Fanconi 
anemia), poor response to G-­CSF, severe congenital neutropenia with 
high risk of myelodysplasia or acute myeloid leukemia.12
	3.	 Complications: See Chapter 22 for management of neutropenic fever 
and typhlitis.
	4.	 Anticipatory guidance:11
	
a.	 Maintain good oral hygiene and skin care to prevent local infections.
	
b.	 Avoid rectal temperatures, rectal examinations, or rectal medications 
due to risk of mucosal trauma and bacteremia.
	
c.	 No live or attenuated-­live vaccines for patients with impaired  
T-­/B-­lymphocyte function. Otherwise follow usual vaccination 
schedule.
	
d.	 If fever >38.4°C, seek emergent care for CBC, blood culture, and 
empiric antibiotics.
	
e.	 Children with mild-­moderate neutropenia can attend school/daycare, 
if they avoid obviously ill children.

III.  THROMBOCYTOPENIA AND IMPAIRED PLATELET FUNCTION
A.  Definition of Thrombocytopenia
	1.	 Defined as platelet count <150,000/μL.
	2.	 See Table 14.1 for age-­specific values. 
B.  Bleeding Risk with Thrombocytopenia
	1.	 Risk of clinically significant bleeding is related to both platelet function 
and number. Unlikely with platelet counts >30,000/μL in the absence of 
other complicating factors.14
	2.	 Risk of severe bleeding (CNS hemorrhage, gross hematuria, melena/hema-
tochezia, hematemesis) increases with platelet counts <10,000/μL.14 
C.  Evaluation of Thrombocytopenia15,16
	1.	 Platelet size: Large = mean platelet volume (MPV) >11 fL, normal = 
MPV 7 to 11 fL, small = MPV <7 fL.
	
a.	 Large platelets suggest increased marrow production in destructive 
processes (e.g., immune thrombocytopenia [ITP]) or some congeni-
tal disorders.
	
b.	 Small platelets suggest production defects, typically seen in congeni-
tal disorders.
	2.	 Peripheral blood smear: Confirm platelet count, evaluate size and mor-
phology, and rule out artifact platelet aggregation (i.e., due to artificial 
clumping in EDTA tube).
	3.	 Immature platelet fraction: Correlates with measure of reticulated plate-
lets, which reflects thrombopoiesis. Increases with peripheral destruc-
tion; is normal/low with bone marrow failure.
	4.	 Bone marrow aspiration: Obtain if systemic symptoms concerning 
for underlying malignancy, involvement other cell lines, and/or blasts 
on smear. Differentiates decreased production versus increased 
destruction. 
D.  Causes of Thrombocytopenia and Impaired Platelet Function
	1.	 See Table 14.9 for an approach to the differential of 
thrombocytopenia.
	2.	 See Table 14.10 for differential of abnormal platelet function. 
E.  Management of Thrombocytopenia
	1.	 ITP17
	
a.	 Pathophysiology: Immune-­mediated destruction of circulating 
platelets.
	
b.	 Presentation: Otherwise healthy 2-­ to 10-­year-­old child with sudden 
bruising or bleeding after recent mild illness or vaccination, isolated 
thrombocytopenia (platelets <100,000/μL), and peripheral smear 
with thrombocytopenia and reticulated large platelets.
	
c.	 Diagnostic testing: No additional testing needed if presentation 
consistent with ITP. If persists >3 to 6 months, pursue further 
workup: Infection testing (human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis 
C, Helicobacter pylori infection), antinuclear antibody, anticardiolipin

children of mothers with antiplatelet antibodies, often related to autoimmune disorders (e.g., immune thrombocytopenic 
purpura or systemic lupus erythematosus).
bThese disorders typically also have disordered platelet function.

d.	 Management: Observation if no or mild bleeding (e.g., skin manifes-
tations). Treat if significant skin/mucosal bleeding with intravenous 
immunoglobulin (IVIG), steroids, or Anti-­Rh (D) immune globulin 
in consultation with a hematologist.18 Only transfuse platelets if 
life-­threatening bleed, often with IVIG and high-­dose steroids. May 
require emergent splenectomy.
	2.	 Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)19
	
a.	 Pathophysiology: Decreased ADAMTS13 activity results in impaired 
processing of von Willebrand factor (vWF) multimers, which causes 
microthrombi.
	
b.	 Presentation: Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), throm-
bocytopenia, acute kidney injury, fever, and neurologic symptoms 
(headache, hemiparesis, coma).
	
c.	 Management: Early plasma exchange with fresh frozen plasma 
(FFP) and glucocorticoids. If high clinical suspicion, treat emergently 
before ADAMTS13 testing results.
	3.	 Hemolytic-­uremic syndrome (HUS)
	
a.	 Pathophysiology: Due to Shiga toxin-­producing Escherichia coli 
O157:H7 or Shigella diarrhea (sometimes Streptococcus pneu-
moniae, HIV).20
	
b.	 Presentation: Early abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, late throm-
bocytopenia and renal failure.
	
c.	 Management: Supportive care with early/aggressive hydration, RBC/
platelet transfusions as needed, antihypertensives, and neurologic 
monitoring.21
	4.	 Complement-­mediated (“Atypical HUS”)
	
a.	 Pathophysiology: Uncontrolled activation of complement on cell 
membranes.21
	
b.	 Diagnostic testing: Complement panel, anti-­CFH antibodies, consider 
genetic screening.
	
c.	 Management: Eculizumab.

	5.	 Drug-­induced thrombocytopenia22
	
a.	 Presentation: Lightheadedness, chills, fever, nausea/vomiting, pur-
pura, petechiae ∼7 days after starting medication (onset variable).
	
b.	 Diagnostic testing for heparin-­induced thrombocytopenia: +anti-­PF4/
heparin antibodies, +serotonin release assay.
	
c.	 Management: Discontinue medication permanently, transfuse if 
severe thrombocytopenia to prevent intracranial or intrapulmonary 
hemorrhage.
	6.	 Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia23
	
a.	 Pathophysiology: Maternal IgG antibodies (usually against paternally 
inherited PLA-­1/HPA-­1a) cross placenta and cause neonatal platelet 
destruction.
	
b.	 Presentation: Severe thrombocytopenia, intracranial hemorrhage 
(ICH).
	
c.	 Diagnostic testing: Identify antipaternal antibodies in infant circula-
tion or maternal and infant platelet antigen typing.
	
d.	 Management: Head ultrasound (US) to screen for ICH, transfuse 
platelets if <30,000/μL or signs of bleeding, consider IVIG if poor 
response to platelet transfusion. 
IV.  COAGULATION
A.  Evaluation of Coagulation and Platelet Function
	1.	 Coagulation
	
a.	 See Fig. 14.3 for coagulation cascade.
	
b.	 Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT): Measures intrinsic sys-
tem and common pathway—Factors V, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, fibrinogen, 
and prothrombin.
	
c.	 Prothrombin time (PT): Measures extrinsic pathway and common 
pathway—Factors V, VII, X, fibrinogen, and prothrombin.
	
d.	 Thrombin time (TT): Measures conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. 
Prolonged with low or dysfunctional fibrinogen and anticoagulants 
(heparin, low molecular weight heparin, direct thrombin inhibitors), 
but not with common pathway abnormalities.
	
e.	 Reptilase time (RT): Normal with heparin or direct thrombin inhibi-
tors, but prolonged with fibrinogen abnormalities.
	
f.	 Mixing study: Used in patients with abnormal clotting (i.e., prolonged 
PT, aPTT, or TT) to determine presence of factor deficiency (corrects 
with addition of normal plasma) or factor inhibitor (no correction 
would occur).
	
g.	 Dilute Russell viper venom time (dRVVT): Russell viper activates factor 
X directly and is sensitive to inhibition by antiphospholipid antibod-
ies. Prolonged dRVVT that corrects with addition of phospholipid 
to assay suggests presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (Lupus 
anticoagulants).24

350    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	
h.	 Fibrinogen: Low levels (<50 to 100 mg/dL) causes impaired clot 
formation and prolongs PT and aPTT. Decreased in disseminated 
intravascular coagulation (DIC), liver disease, traumatic hemorrhage.
	
i.	 D-­dimer: Fibrin degradation product increased with recent/ongoing 
fibrinolysis (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, DIC, 
and many other clinical scenarios).
	
j.	 Thromboelastography (TEG): Whole blood test that rapidly measures 
time parameters of clot formation and overall clot strength, detects 
increased fibrinolysis. Useful for identification of coagulopathy and to 
guide transfusion in cardiac surgery and trauma.25
	2.	 Platelet function12
	
a.	 Always assess platelet number and use of platelet inhibitors (e.g., nonste-
roidal anti-­inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) before platelet function testing.
	
b.	 Light transmission aggregometry (LTA): Measures platelet aggregation 
in vitro.16
	
c.	 Platelet function analyzer-­100 (PFA-­100): Measures primary hemo-
stasis (platelet adhesion, activation, and aggregation) in vitro.16
	
d.	 Bleeding time (BT): Evaluates clot formation, including platelet num-
ber/function and vWF, in vivo. Technically challenging to perform and 
has been largely replaced by above tests. 
B.  Definition of Abnormal Coagulation
	1.	 An incorrect anticoagulant-­to-­blood ratio will give inaccurate results.
	2.	 See Table 14.11 at end of chapter which lists normal hematologic 
values for coagulation testing. 
C.  Causes and Management of Coagulopathy
	1.	 Medications
	
a.	 Heparin affects aPTT, thrombin time, dRVVT, and mixing studies.
	
b.	 Warfarin affects PT, may mildly affect aPTT, and interferes with 
dRVVT by reducing the activity of vitamin K–dependent factors  
(II, VII, IX, X, protein C and S).
	2.	 Disseminated intravascular coagulation
	
a.	 Tissue damage (e.g., due to sepsis, trauma, malignancy) results in 
tissue factor release and systemic activation of coagulation system, 
consumption of coagulation factors and platelets, increased fibrin 
formation and fibrinolysis, MAHA, bleeding, and microthromboses.26
	
b.	 Diagnosis: Prolonged P T and aPTT, decreased fibrinogen, thrombo-
cytopenia, increased D-­Dimer, increased fibrin degradation products, 
and presence of schistocytes on peripheral smear.
	
c.	 Treatment: Address underlying condition and supportive care. May 
require FFP, cryoprecipitate, and/or platelet transfusions if active 
bleeding or high bleeding risk.
	3.	 Liver disease
	
a.	 The liver is the major site of synthesis of factors V, VII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII.
	
b.	 It is also involved in the synthesis of prothrombin, plasminogen, 
fibrinogen, proteins C and S, and ATIII.
 

--- Page 462 ---
Chapter 14  Hematology    351
14
	4.	 Vitamin K deficiency
	
a.	 Often secondary to liver disease, pancreatic insufficiency, malabsorp-
tion, exclusive breastfeeding, prolonged antibiotic use, malignancy.
	
b.	 Necessary for synthesis of factors II, VII, IX, X, protein C, and protein S.12
	
c.	 Treatment: Parenteral vitamin K corrects PT in 2 to 6 hours. Oral 
form corrects in 6-­8 hours.27 Give FFP if evidence of severe bleed-
ing. Prothrombin complex concentrate can be given in cases of 
life-­threatening hemorrhage or ICH.
	5.	 Hemophilia A (Factor VIII deficiency) and Hemophilia B (Factor IX 
deficiency)28
	
a.	 Etiology: X-­linked recessive disorders. Females can be symptomatic carriers.
	
b.	 Diagnosis: Prolonged aPTT that corrects with mixing study, normal 
PT, low factor assays. Mild forms can have normal aPTT.
	
c.	 Classification of disease severity:28
	
(1)	 Severe: <1% activity; spontaneous bleed (hemarthrosis, hema-
toma) without trauma.
	
(2)	 Moderate: 1% to 5% activity; bleeding after minor trauma.
	
(3)	 Mild: 5% to 40% activity; bleeding with surgery or significant trauma.
	
d.	 Bleeding prophylaxis:
	
(1)	 Home prophylaxis: Intravenous (IV) factor replacement (per 
individualized protocols) to maintain factor level >1 IU/dL to 
prevent spontaneous bleeds and preserve joint function. Initiate 
before onset of frequent bleeding, typically in 1-­ to 3-­year-­olds.29 
Emicizumab-­kxwh is a bispecific antibody that is delivered sub-
cutaneously (SQ) and can be used for prophylaxis.
	
(2)	 Surgical prophylaxis: Factor replacement for goal factor level 
80 to 100 IU/dL (major procedure) or 50 to 80 IU/dL (minor 
procedure) preoperatively and through postoperative period of 
bleeding risk.28 Consult hematologist before any diagnostic or 
therapeutic procedure, including dental, endoscopy with biopsy, 
arterial blood gas, etc.
	
e.	 Treatment of acute bleeds:
	
(1)	 Always remember: “Factor first!” Do not delay first dose for 
evaluation.
	
(2)	 Bolus dose FVIII or FVIX concentrate. May require additional 
doses.
	
(3)	 Consult hematologist for all major bleeding.
	
(4)	 See Table 14.12 for desired factor replacement level and dosing.
	
(5)	 Half-­life of Factor VIII: 8 to 12 hours. Half-­life Factor IX: 18 to 24 
hours.28
	
(6)	 If suspected intracranial bleed, replete 100% factor level imme-
diately on presentation and before additional diagnostic testing 
(e.g., CT scan).
	
(7)	 Alternative treatments for mild Hemophilia A: Desmopressin (DDAVP) 
and antifibrinolytic agents (tranexamic acid, aminocaproic acid).
 

--- Page 463 ---
352    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	
(8)	 Can use cryoprecipitate (for Hemophilia A, not for Hemophilia B) 
or FFP if no factor available.
	
f.	 Factor inhibitors: IgG antibodies that develop with repeat factor 
exposure and complicate treatment. Patients with severe hemophilia 
A are at the highest risk.
	
(1)	 Screen for inhibitors with inhibitor assay if poor clinical response 
to factor. Consider screen during initiation of factor treatment 
and preoperatively.
	
(2)	 In the presence of inhibitors, patients may require higher doses 
of factor, recombinant FVIIa, or activated prothrombin complex 
concentrates.
	
g.	 Healthcare maintenance
	
(1)	 Vaccinations: Given per routine schedule. Give prophylactic fac-
tor for intramuscular vaccines or give vaccine SQ with smallest 
gauge needle without factor prophylaxis.28
	
(2)	 Physical activity: Avoid high contact (e.g., soccer, hockey) and 
high velocity (e.g., skiing) activities.28
	
(3)	 Medications to avoid: Aspirin, NSAIDs, anticoagulants.
	
(4)	 Many younger children will need a central venous catheter for 
factor delivery and must therefore follow strict fever guidelines.
	6.	 Von Willebrand (vW) disease
	
a.	 Pathophysiology: Most common inherited bleeding disorder. 
Abnormal platelet adhesion and aggregation, low factor VIII.30
	
b.	 Diagnosis: Low circulating vWF antigen (VWF:Ag) and/or low vWF function 
on ristocetin-­based platelet aggregation study (VWF:RCo), low or normal 
factor VIII activity, prolonged PFA-­100. May require additional evaluation.
	
c.	 Classification:30
	
(1)	 Type 1 (75% to 80% cases): Partial quantitative deficiency.
	
(2)	 Type 2 (20% to 25%): Qualitative dysfunction.

(3)	 Type 3 (rare): Absence or near absence of vWF + markedly low 
factor VIII activity (can resemble Hemophilia A patient on labs 
and presentation).
	
d.	 Treatment:30
	
(1)	 Desmopressin (DDAVP): Stimulates vWF release. Given IV or 
intranasal. May be used as prophylaxis for minor surgeries or 
treatment for mild bleeding. Ineffective in Type 3, variable effect 
in Type 2. Patients should be tested for DDAVP response before 
using as prophylaxis.
	
(2)	 VWF-­containing concentrates (Humate-­P, Alphanate, or Wilate): 
Replaces vWF and factor VIII and derived from blood donors. 
Recombinant vWF available (VONVENDI). Used for severe 
bleeding events and surgery.
	
(3)	 Cryoprecipitate only appropriate for life-­threatening situations if 
vWF concentrate unavailable.
	
(4)	 Alternative therapies: IV or oral antifibrinolytic therapy (tranexamic 
acid and aminocaproic acid) can be used to prevent or treat mild 
mucocutaneous bleeding alone or in conjunction with other therapies. 
D.  Causes of Hypercoagulability
	1.	 Most thrombotic events are due to an acquired condition; however, 
an inherited thrombophilia is more likely if there is a family history, an 
unusual thrombus location, absence of an inciting factor, and/or recur-
rent thromboses.
	2.	 See Table 14.13 for etiologies and evaluation of hypercoagulable states.
	3.	 Acquired conditions associated with venous thromboembolism 
include endothelial damage (vascular catheters, sepsis, smoking, 
diabetes, hypertension, surgery, hyperlipidemia), disturbed blood 
flow (central venous lines, congenital heart disease), hyperviscos-
ity (macroglobulinemia, polycythemia, sickle cell disease), platelet 
activation (essential thrombocytosis, oral contraceptives, heparin-­
induced thrombocytopenia), malignancy, inflammatory bowel disease, 
parenteral nutrition, nephrotic syndrome, paroxysmal nocturnal 
hemoglobinuria.

MANAGEMENT OF EXCESSIVE WARFARIN ANTICOAGULATION
INR and Bleeding
Intervention
INR 4–4.5 without  
serious bleeding
Hold or lower next warfarin dose.
Recheck INR daily.
For patients with high bleeding risk, consider standard dose of 
oral vitamin K.a
When INR approaches therapeutic range, resume warfarin 
therapy.
INR ≥4.5 but <10  
without serious bleeding
Hold warfarin.
Recheck INR every 24 hr until <4.
If high risk for bleeding, give standard dose of oral vitamin Ka.
When INR approaches therapeutic range, resume warfarin at a 
lower dose.
INR ≥10 without  
serious bleeding
Hold warfarin.
Recheck INR every 12 hr.
Give high dose oral vitamin K every 12–24 hr as necessaryb.
When INR approaches therapeutic range, resume warfarin at a 
lower dose.
Minor bleeding at  
any INR elevation
Hold warfarin.
Monitor INR every 12–24 hr depending on bleeding severity.
Give standard dose oral vitamin K and repeat as necessary if 
bleeding continues and INR not corrected at 24 hra.
Restart warfarin when INR approaches therapeutic range and 
when clinically appropriate at a lower dose.
Significant or life-­threatening 
bleeding at any INR
Hold warfarin.
Monitor INR every 4–6 hr.
Administer high dose vitamin K IV, repeat as neededb.
Transfusion of FFP (10–15 mL/kg IV), consider prothrombin 
complex concentrate; consult blood bank and/or hema­tology 
for dosing.
Restart warfarin when INR approaches therapeutic range and 
when clinically appropriate at a lower dose.
aStandard dose Vitamin K: 0.03 mg/kg PO for patients <40 kg in weight; 1–2.5 mg PO for patients ≥40 kg. For rapid 
reversal, 0.5–2.5 mg IV slow infusion over 30 minutes. Expect INR reduction at 24–48 hr.
b†High dose Vitamin K: 0.06 mg/kg PO for patients <40 kg in weight; 5–10 mg for patients ≥40 kg. For emergent situa-
tions, 5–10 mg IV slow infusion over 30 minutes. Expect INR reduction at 12–14 hr.
NOTE: Always evaluate for bleeding risks and potential drug interactions. Do not give intramuscular Vitamin K to children 
on anticoagulants.

VII.  ONLINE CONTENT
A.  Specific PRBC Types
	1.	 Leukoreduced RBCs: 99.9% white blood cells (WBCs) removed to 
reduce risks of pathogen transmission (e.g., CMV), HLA alloimmuniza-
tion and febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reaction.
	2.	 Washed RBCs: Removal of plasma proteins in products for recipients 
with history of anaphylactic transfusions reactions or complete IgA 
deficiency.
	3.	 CMV-­safe RBCs: Leukoreduced units likely comparable to low transmis-
sion risk with CMV-­seronegative units (from donors with negative CMV 
serology). Preferred for vulnerable populations: CMV-­negative bone 
marrow transplant or solid organ recipients, immunodeficient patients, 
premature or low birth weight infants, intrauterine transfusions, preg-
nant women.
	4.	 Irradiated blood products: Inactivated donor lymphocytes capable of 
causing transfusion-­associated graft versus host disease (GVHD).33 
Used for susceptible patients: leukemia, lymphoma, BMT, solid organ 
transplant, intensive chemotherapy, known/suspected immune defi-
ciency, intrauterine transfusions, neonate transfusions, patients receiv-
ing T-­cell suppressive therapy. Also necessary in directed donation from 
a relative. 
B.  Directed Donor Transfusions
	1.	 When to consider directed donor:
	
a.	 Chronic transfusion programs (e.g., “blood buddy” programs), where 
donors provide antigen-­matched red cells repetitively for the same 
patient requiring frequent transfusions (e.g., thalassemia, sickle cell 
disease).
	
b.	 NAIT, where maternal platelets lack causative antigens and represent 
optimal therapy.
	2.	 Reasons to not consider directed donor:
	
a.	 Practice not often feasible. Specific screening, donation, product 
testing, and processing causes delays (2 to 3 days or more) when 
compatible blood is often readily available.
	
b.	 Directed donor may not be compatible: must be at least ABO/RhD 
compatible, and may require other RBC antigen compatibility if 
recipient has antibodies.
	
c.	 Directed donors less likely to be truthful in donor screening, causing 
potential increased infection risk.
	
d.	 Products from a relative require irradiation for increased risk of 
transfusion-­related graft-­versus-­host disease (GVHD).
	
e.	 If RBC donor is also a potential bone marrow transplant donor for 
recipient, donation increases risk of development of donor-­directed 
human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies in recipient, which may 
cause graft failure.

Immunology and Allergy
Carlos A. Salgado, MD
I.  ALLERGIC RHINITIS1–6
A.  Epidemiology
	1.	 Most common pediatric chronic medical condition: Prevalence in chil-
dren up to 40%.
	2.	 Increases risk for recurrent otitis media, asthma, and acute and chronic 
sinusitis.
	3.	 Risk factors: Atopic family history, serum immunoglobulin (Ig) E >100 
IU/mL before age 6 years, higher socioeconomic status, and infant 
exposure to maternal smoking in utero and during early childhood. 
B.  Diagnosis
	1.	 History:
	
a.	 Allergen-­driven mucosal inflammation leading to cyclical exacerba-
tions or persistent symptoms.
	
b.	 Symptoms: Nasal (congestion, rhinorrhea, and pruritus), ocular 
(pruritus and tearing), and postnasal drip (sore throat and cough).
	
c.	 Patterns: Seasonal (depending on local allergens) versus perennial 
(with seasonal peaks)
	
d.	 Coexisting atopic diseases common (eczema, asthma, and food 
allergy).
	2.	 Physical examination:
	
a.	 Allergic facies with shiners, mouth breathing, transverse nasal 
crease (“allergic salute”), and accentuated lines below lower eyelids 
(Dennie-­Morgan lines).
	
b.	 May have swollen nasal turbinates.
	
c.	 Injected sclera with or without clear discharge, conjunctival 
cobblestoning.
	3.	 Diagnostic studies:
	
a.	 Diagnosis can be made on clinical grounds, however allergy with 
skin tests or allergen-­specific IgE testing can identify specific allergic 
sensitivities.
	
b.	 Total IgE, peripheral blood eosinophil count and imaging studies are 
not recommended due to poor specificity. 
C.  Differential Diagnosis
Vasomotor/nonallergic rhinitis (hypersensitivity to scents, alcohol, or 
changes in climate), infectious rhinitis, adenoid hypertrophy, rhinitis medi-
camentosa (rebound rhinitis from prolonged use of nasal vasoconstrictors), 
sinusitis, nonallergic rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome, and nasal polyps.

Chapter 15  Immunology and Allergy    369
15
D.  Treatment
	1.	 Allergen avoidance:
	
a.	 Relies on identification of triggers, most common of which are pol-
lens, fungi, dust mites, insects, and animals.
	
b.	 HEPA filter may be useful when animal allergens are a concern.
	
c.	 Thorough housecleaning and allergy-­proof bed coverings can be useful.
	2.	 Oral antihistamines:
	
a.	 First-­line treatment for mild or episodic symptoms or young patients 
who cannot tolerate or refuse nasal sprays.
	
b.	 Second-­ and third-­generation preparations preferable (loratadine, 
desloratadine, fexofenadine, cetirizine, and levocetirizine) due to 
reduced central nervous system (CNS) side effects.
	
c.	 Adverse effects: Sedation and anticholinergic side effects (more 
prominent with first-­generation agents).
	3.	 Intranasal corticosteroids (fluticasone, mometasone, budesonide, fluni-
solide, ciclesonide, and triamcinolone):
	
a.	 First-­line for persistent or moderate-­to-­severe symptoms, as it is the 
most effective single maintenance therapy for nasal congestion and 
reduction of ocular symptoms.
	
b.	 Maximal therapeutic benefit when used over several days or weeks. 
No effect with as-needed use.
	
c.	 Adverse effects: Nasal irritation, sneezing, bleeding, and potential 
risk of reduction in growth velocity and adrenal suppression at high 
doses, especially in patients on multiple steroid preparations. Growth 
monitoring recommended.
	
d.	 Administration: Clear mucus crusting, keep head pointed slightly 
down and avoid pointing medication at nasal septum.
	4.	 Leukotriene inhibitors (montelukast):
	
a.	 More effective in combination with antihistamines.
	
b.	 Consider in patients with concomitant asthma.
	5.	 Intranasal antihistamines (azelastine and olopatadine):
	
a.	 Effective for acute symptoms; faster onset of action than glucocorti-
coid nasal spray.
	
b.	 Adverse effects: Bitter taste, systemic absorption with potential for 
sedation.
	6.	 Intranasal combination agents (azelastine/fluticasone): Useful for 
patients with moderate-­to-­severe allergic rhinitis.
	7.	 Immunotherapy:
	
a.	 Success rate is high when patients are chosen carefully and when 
performed by an allergy specialist.
	
b.	 Consider when symptoms are inadequately controlled with medica-
tions and allergen avoidance.
	
c.	 In addition to traditional subcutaneous immunotherapy, sublingual 
products have now been approved for several allergens.
	
d.	 Not recommended for patients with poor adherence to therapy or 
those with poorly controlled asthma.
 

--- Page 486 ---
370    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	
e.	 Not well studied in children younger than 5 years.
	
f.	 May reduce risk for future development of asthma, and treatment of 
allergic rhinitis may improve asthma control.
	8.	 Nasal irrigation with hypertonic saline: Use distilled, sterile, or boiled 
water (at least 3 minutes) for homemade solutions.
	9.	 Ophthalmic agents: Can be used to treat allergic conjunctivitis. Up 
to 60% of patients with allergic rhinitis have concomitant conjunc-
tivitis. Avoid the use of steroids unless under the direction of an 
ophthalmologist.
	
a.	 Mast cell stabilizers: Cromolyn sodium, lodoxamide-­tromethamine, 
nedocromil, and pemirolast.
	
b.	 H1-­antagonists and mast cell stabilizers: Alcaftadine, azelastine 
HCl, bepotastine, emedastine, epinastine, ketotifen fumarate, and 
olopatadine. 
II.  FOOD ALLERGY7–12
A.  Epidemiology
	1.	 Prevalence is 6% to 8% in young children and 3% to 4% in 
adolescence.
	2.	 Most common allergens in children: Milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts (e.g., 
cashew, walnut), soy, fish, shellfish, and wheat. 
B.  Manifestations of Food Allergy
	1.	 Often a combination of several syndromes; symptoms can occur within 
minutes to hours of ingesting food.
	2.	 Diagnosis requires both sensitization (demonstration of allergen-­specific 
IgE) and clinical symptoms after exposure to allergens.
	3.	 Anaphylaxis: See Chapter 1.
	4.	 Skin syndromes:
	
a.	 Urticaria/angioedema:
	
(1)	 Chronic urticaria is rarely related to food allergy.
	
(2)	 Acute urticaria due to food allergy may be a risk factor for future 
anaphylaxis.
	
b.	 Atopic dermatitis/eczema:
	
(1)	 Food allergy is more common in patients with atopic dermatitis.
	
(2)	 Even if not apparent by history, at least one-­third of children with 
moderate to severe atopic dermatitis have IgE-­mediated food 
allergies.
	5.	 Gastrointestinal syndromes:
	
a.	 Oral allergy syndrome:
	
(1)	 Pollen-­associated food allergy caused by cross-­reactivity of anti-
bodies to pollens (e.g., apple and tree pollen).
	
(2)	 Pruritus of oral mucosa after ingestion of certain fresh fruits 
and vegetables in patients with pollen allergies. Rarely results in 
edema of oral mucosa, or progresses beyond mouth/throat.
	
(3)	 Inciting antigens are usually denatured by cooking.
 

--- Page 487 ---
Chapter 15  Immunology and Allergy    371
15
	
b.	 Allergic eosinophilic gastroenteritis, esophagitis: see Chapter 12
	
c.	 Food protein induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES):
	
(1)	 Presents in infancy.
	
(2)	 Vomiting and diarrhea (may contain blood); when severe, may 
lead to lethargy, dehydration, hypotension, acidosis.
	
(3)	 Most commonly associated with milk and soy, but may 
occur with a wide variety of foods (e.g., rice, oat, fruits, and 
vegetables).
	
d.	 Infantile proctocolitis:
	
(1)	 Confined to distal colon and can present with diarrhea or blood-­
streaked and mucous-­containing stools.
	
(2)	 Symptoms usually resolve within 72 hours of stopping offending 
agent; rarely leads to anemia. 
C.  Diagnosis of Food Allergy (Fig. 15.1)
	1.	 History and physical examination:
	
a.	 Identify specific foods and whether fresh vs. cooked.
	
b.	 Establish timing and nature of reactions.
	2.	 Skin testing:
	
a.	 Skin prick test has poor positive predictive value, but very good nega-
tive predictive value.
	
b.	 Patient must not be taking antihistamines.
	
c.	 Widespread skin conditions (e.g., dermatographism, urticaria, severe 
eczema) may limit ability to perform skin tests.
	3.	 Measurement of allergen-­specific IgE:
	
a.	 Similar to skin tests, it has poor positive predictive value and excel-
lent negative predictive value.
	
b.	 Levels above a certain range (variable amongst different antigens) 
have increasing positive predictive value.
	
c.	 Useful in patients with dermatologic conditions that preclude skin 
testing.
	
d.	 Component testing (measuring IgE to specific food proteins rather 
than crude extracts) may improve diagnostic accuracy for peanut 
and possibly other foods.
	4.	 Oral food challenges:
	
a.	 Can verify clinical reactivity to a specific food allergen or document 
that a food allergy has been outgrown.
	
b.	 Must be performed under close medical supervision with emergency 
medications readily available.
	
c.	 Patient must not be taking antihistamines.
	
d.	 Most accurate when double-­blinded using graded doses of disguised 
food.
	5.	 Trial elimination diet:
	
a.	 Helpful if improvement with removal of food from diet.
	
b.	 Essential, especially in infants and for non-­IgE-­mediated food 
allergy. 
 

--- Page 488 ---
372    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
D.  Differential Diagnosis
	1.	 Food intolerance: Nonimmunologic, based on toxins or other properties 
of foods leading to adverse effects.
	2.	 Malabsorption syndromes:
	
a.	 Cystic fibrosis, celiac disease (see Chapter 12), and lactase 
deficiency.
	
b.	 Gastrointestinal malformations.

15
E.  Treatment
	1.	 Allergen avoidance:
	
a.	 Most important intervention for all types of food allergy.
	
b.	 Patients must pay close attention to food ingredients. Implement an 
“If you can’t read it, you can’t eat it” approach to avoid risky unla-
beled foods.
	
c.	 Nutritional counseling and regular growth monitoring are 
recommended.
	2.	 Nonanaphylactic angioedema/urticaria:
	
a.	 Antihistamines or corticosteroids, based on severity and duration of 
symptoms.
	
b.	 Omalizumab used for chronic urticaria.
	3.	 Atopic dermatitis: Symptomatic control (see Chapter 8).
	4.	 Anaphylaxis:
	
a.	 See Chapter 1 for management of anaphylaxis.
	
b.	 Prescribe epinephrine auto-­injector for all at-­risk patients. Counsel to 
call 9-­1-­1 if using.
	
c.	 Develop Anaphylaxis Action Plan indicating specific allergies, symp-
toms for which to observe, and medications to be administered.
	
d.	 Counsel families to always have epinephrine auto-injector readily 
available.
	
e.	 Make school aware of Anaphylaxis Action Plan and ensure they can 
administer lifesaving medications.
	5.	 Food-­specific immunotherapy is under investigation. It is used to induce 
clinical desensitization to specific allergens. 
F.  Natural History
	1.	 About 50% of milk, egg, soy, and wheat allergies are outgrown by school age.
	2.	 Peanut, tree nut, and shellfish allergies are outgrown only in 10% to 20%.
	3.	 Skin tests and allergen-­specific IgE may remain positive, even though 
symptoms resolve. 
III.  DRUG ALLERGY13,14
A.  Definition
	1.	 Drug allergy: Immunologically mediated response to an agent in a sensi-
tized person.
	2.	 Drug intolerance: Undesirable pharmacologic effect.
	3.	 Although 10% of patients report penicillin allergy, after evaluation, about 
90% of these individuals can tolerate penicillin. 
B.  Diagnosis
	1.	 Cutaneous manifestations are the most common presentation for drug 
allergic reactions.
	2.	 Diagnostic studies: Penicillin is the only drug for which standardized 
skin testing reagents and procedures have been validated. Skin testing 
or supervised graded dose challenge may be done with caution for other 
 

--- Page 490 ---
374    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
medications, but the results must be carefully considered in the context 
of the clinical pictures, as both false positive and false negative results 
are common. 
C.  Management (Fig. 15.2)
	1.	 Avoidance: When able, utilize alternative therapy.
	2.	 Desensitization: Progressive administration of an allergenic substance to 
render immune system less reactive.

	3.	 Graded challenge: Administration of progressively increasing doses of a 
drug until full dose is reached; does not modify a patient’s response to 
the drug, but is used to optimize safety when the history and test results 
are not completely reassuring.

b.	 Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (see Chapter 14):
	
(1)	 Initially given on a single day or in divided doses over 2 to 5 
consecutive days.
	
(2)	 Maintenance dose given every 3 to 6 weeks based on clinical 
response and platelet count.
	
c.	 Bone marrow transplantation:
	
(1)	 Adjust dosing to maintain trough IgG level of at least 400 mg/dL.
	
(2)	 May decrease incidence of infection and death but not acute 
graft-­versus-­host disease.
	
d.	 Other indications:
	
(1)	 Kawasaki disease (see Chapter 7).
	
(2)	 Guillain-­Barré syndrome.
	
(3)	 Refractory dermatomyositis and polymyositis.
	
(4)	 Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.
	2.	 Precautions and adverse reactions:
	
a.	 Severe systemic symptoms (hemodynamic changes, respiratory dif-
ficulty, and anaphylaxis).
	
b.	 Less-­severe systemic reactions (headache, myalgia, fever, chills, 
nausea, and vomiting).
	
(1)	 Decrease infusion rate and/or premedicate with intravenous 
corticosteroids, and/or antipyretics.
	
(2)	 Can progress to aseptic meningitis syndrome.
	
c.	 Acute renal failure (increased risk with preexisting renal insufficiency 
and with sucrose-­containing IVIG).
	
d.	 Acute venous thrombosis (increased risk with sucrose-­containing 
IVIG).
	
e.	 Use with caution in patients with confirmed undetectable IgA levels 
(e.g., patients with partial B-­cell immunodeficiencies or familial 
IgA deficiency), as antibodies against IgA may trigger anaphylactic 
reaction. 
B.  Intramuscular Immunoglobulin (IMIG)
	1.	 Prophylaxis Indications: Hepatitis A, measles, rubella, rabies, and 
varicella-­zoster (see Chapter 16).
	2.	 Precautions and adverse reactions:
	
a.	 Similar to IVIG (discussed previously).
	
b.	 Local reaction at injection site increases with repeated use.
	
c.	 Intravenous or intradermal use of IMIG is absolutely contraindicated 
due to high risk for anaphylactoid reactions.
	3.	 Administration:
	
a.	 No more than 5 mL should be given at one site in large child/adoles-
cent, and 1 to 3 mL for smaller children/infants.
	
b.	 Administration of greater than 15 mL at one time is essentially never 
warranted.
	
c.	 Peak serum levels achieved by 48 hours; immune effect lasts 3 to 4 
weeks.

378    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
C.  Subcutaneous Immunoglobulin
	1.	 Indication: Replacement therapy for antibody deficiency.
	2.	 Dose:
	
a.	 See the Formulary for dosages and administration instructions.
	
b.	 Larger doses can be given simultaneously in multiple sites or more 
frequently than once weekly.
	
c.	 Using the same areas for injections improves tolerability.
	3.	 Precautions and adverse reactions:
	
a.	 Systemic side effects are rare because of the small volumes given 
and the slow absorption rate.
	
b.	 Local redness and swelling are expected and generally decrease with 
every infusion.
	4.	 Considerations: Does not require venous access or special nursing (par-
ents can administer), but may require multiple needlesticks in larger 
children, depending on the volume to be infused. 
D.  Specific Immunoglobulins
	1.	 Hyperimmune globulins:
	
a.	 Prepared from donors with high titers of specific antibodies.
	
b.	 Includes hepatitis B immune globulin, varicella-­zoster immune 
globulin, cytomegalovirus immune globulin, Rho(D) immune globu-
lin, botulism immune globulin, and others.
	2.	 Monoclonal antibody preparations (rituximab, palivizumab, and others). 
E.  Vaccination Timing
See Chapter 16 for discussion of timing of routine vaccination after immu-
noglobulin administration.

	3.	 Combination vaccines can reduce number of injections.
	
a.	 MMR-­Varicella (ProQuad)4 can be used for children 12 months 
through 12 years of age. There is an increased risk of febrile seizures 
if given as first dose for ages 12 to 47 months.
	
b.	 HepB-­containing5 combination vaccines should not be administered 
to infants <6 weeks because of the other components.
	4.	 Simultaneous administration
	
a.	 Routine childhood vaccines are safe and effective when adminis-
tered simultaneously at different sites. There is no maximum number 
of vaccines that can be coadministered.
	
b.	 If live vaccines are not given at the same visit, they should be sepa-
rated by an interval of 28 days. 
C.  Live, Attenuated Vaccines
	1.	 Certain vaccines have live components that must replicate to produce 
immunity: Influenza (intranasal), MMR, oral polio vaccine (OPV), BCG, 
typhoid (oral), varicella, yellow fever.
	2.	 Systemic adverse reactions following these vaccines are usually mild, 
and usually occur 3 to 21 days after the vaccine is given.
	3.	 Special consideration must be taken when administering these vaccines 
to patients with certain underlying medical conditions (see Section IV). 
D.  Timing and Spacing of Vaccine Doses
	1.	 For information on recommended timing and spacing of vaccines, see: 
http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-­recs/general-­recs/timing.html.
	2.	 Combination vaccines
	
a.	 Minimum age for administration is the oldest age for any of the indi-
vidual components.
	
b.	 Minimum interval between doses is equal to the greatest interval of 
any of the individual components. 
E.  Contraindications and Precautions6
	1.	 Contraindication: A condition that increases the likelihood of a serious 
adverse reaction to a vaccine for a patient with that condition.
	2.	 Precaution: A condition that may increase the likelihood or severity of an 
adverse reaction in a vaccine recipient, or may compromise the ability 
of the vaccine to produce immunity.
	3.	 Table 16.3: Contraindications and precautions to select vaccines.
	4.	 Table 16.4: Conditions incorrectly perceived as contraindications or pre-
cautions to vaccination (vaccines may be given under these conditions).

(2)	 Obtaining titers and revaccinating those with unprotective levels.
	
c.	 Timing of resumption of immunization varies based on the patient’s 
specific treatment regimen (from 3 months to ≥24 months).
	
(1)	 Inactivated vaccines are generally delayed until ≥6 months after 
the end of chemotherapy.
	
(2)	 Live vaccines are generally delayed until ≥12 months after the 
end of chemotherapy.
	
d.	 Inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) should be given annually, even 
during chemotherapy.
	7.	 Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients
	
a.	 After transplant, HSCT recipients are considered to have lost immu-
nity to all vaccines. Reimmunize against all vaccine-­preventable 
illnesses.
	
(1)	 Inactivated vaccines are safe to administer 6 to 12 months after 
HSCT. Our center starts the pneumococcal series at 6 months 
and the remainder at 12 months.
	
(2)	 IIV may be given as early at 6 months post-­HSCT. Children 
≤8 years should receive two doses. Do not administer 
LAIV. During a community outbreak, IIV may be given 3 
to 4 months post-­HSCT, with a second dose 4 weeks later 
­regardless of age.
	
(3)	 Avoid live vaccines during the first 24 months post transplant.
	
(4)	 For specific vaccine recommendations, see Table EC 16.B.
	
b.	 Consider passive immunoprophylaxis or chemoprophylaxis after 
exposures (see Table 16.5).
	
c.	 Household contacts should receive routine immunizations. Only 
exception is LAIV if the HSCT recipient’s level of immunocompromise 
is severe (e.g., HSCT in last 3 months). HSCT recipients should avoid 
contact with body fluids or skin eruptions of household contact who 
received rotavirus or varicella vaccines, respectively.
	 8.	 Solid organ transplant recipients
	
a.	 See Section IV.B.3 for pneumococcal vaccination recommendations.
	
b.	 Before transplant: Give all routinely recommended vaccines. Give live 
vaccines ≥4 weeks prior to transplantation.
	
(1)	 Children 6 to 11 months can receive MMR if not immunosup-
pressed and if transplant is ≥4 weeks away.
	
(2)	 Children 6 to 11 months (or without evidence of varicella immu-
nity) can receive varicella vaccine if not immunosuppressed and 
if transplant is ≥4 weeks away.
	
c.	 After transplant: Inactivated vaccines, including those indicated for 
immunocompromised hosts, should resume 2 to 6 months after 
transplant. Live vaccines are generally not given after transplant. For 
specific vaccine recommendations, see Table EC 16.C.
	 9.	 Patients on corticosteroids
	
a.	 Only live vaccines are potentially contraindicated.
	
b.	 See Table 16.6 for details.

V.  COUNSELING AND COMMUNICATION ABOUT VACCINES16-­26
A.  Vaccine Hesitancy
	1.	 Definition: Delay in the acceptance or refusal to vaccinate despite the 
availability of vaccine services. Not a dichotomous behavior, but a con-
tinuum. Vaccine-­hesitant parents may accept all vaccines but remain 
concerned, accept some vaccines and refuse others, or refuse all vaccines. 
Approximately 3% of parents in the United States refuse all vaccines.20
	2.	 The AAP recommends continued engagement with vaccine-­hesitant 
parents while providing other health services and attempting to modify 
opposition to vaccines.
	3.	 Determinants of vaccine acceptance
	
a.	 The 3C Model: Confidence, Complacency, Convenience. Key deter-
minants of vaccine acceptance in global populations as determined 
by the World Health Organization (WHO) SAGE Working Group on 
Vaccine Hesitancy. See Online Content for more details.
	
b.	 Parental concerns about vaccines (Box 16.1) 
BOX 16.1
PARENTAL CONCERNS ABOUT VACCINES
Vaccine Safety
Too many vaccines
Development of autism
Vaccine additives (thimerosal, aluminum)
Overload of the immune system
Serious adverse reactions
Potential for long-­term adverse events
Inadequate research performed before licensure
May cause pain to the child
May make the child sick 
Necessity of Vaccines
Disease is more “natural” than vaccine
Parents do not believe diseases being prevented are serious
Vaccine-­preventable diseases have disappeared
Not all vaccines are needed
Vaccines do not work 
Freedom of Choice
Parents have the right to choose whether to immunize their child
Parents know what’s best for their child
Believe that the risks outweigh the benefits of vaccine
Do not trust organized medicine, public health
Do not trust government health authorities
Do not trust pharmaceutical companies
Ethical, moral, or religious reasons

	1.	 Parent and/or patient-­specific concerns should be acknowledged and 
addressed while correcting misconceptions in a nonconfrontational manner.
	2.	 Relationship with primary care provider/pediatrician is a strong influ-
ence on decision to vaccinate. Mutual desire to do what is best for the 
child should be emphasized.

	1.	 Confidence: Trust in healthcare professionals, vaccines, and their effec-
tiveness. Includes concerns regarding vaccine safety, quality of interac-
tions with healthcare providers, religious beliefs, and media influence.
	2.	 Complacency: Low awareness of the risks of vaccine-­preventable dis-
eases and the importance of vaccines. Includes resistance to introduc-
tion of new vaccines, resistance to mode of vaccine delivery, and lack of 
knowledge about the risks of now uncommon diseases.
	3.	 Convenience: Availability of and accessibility to vaccines and healthcare 
services (rural areas, low-­middle income countries). Includes vaccine 
supply issues, lack of education or medical literacy, geographic barriers, 
political conflicts and instability, and immigration. 
C.  Strategies to Address Vaccine Hesitancy18-­19,22-­26
	1.	 Communication
	
a.	 Studies have found that parents want more information than they 
are getting, want balanced information about potential benefits and 
harms, struggle to find unbiased, trustworthy sources of infor-
mation, and view healthcare workers as an important source of 
information.
	
b.	 Consider the timing for making vaccination information available to 
parents, the settings where information is available, the provision 
of impartial and clear information tailored to parental needs, and 
parents’ perceptions of health workers and the information provided.
	
c.	 AAP Communication Highlights (Box EC 16.A)
	2.	 Interventions
	
a.	 SAGE Working Group assessed systematic reviews and meta-­
analyses of worldwide strategies to address vaccine hesitancy. No 
convincing evidence that any specific intervention to address paren-
tal vaccine hesitancy/refusal is effective across populations.
	
b.	 Most effective interventions were tailored to specific populations and 
addressing specific concerns, pointing to the importance of under-
standing the drivers of vaccine hesitancy to inform the interventions.
	
c.	 Most successful interventions were multicomponent strategies 
that directly targeted unvaccinated/under vaccinated populations, 
aimed to increase vaccine knowledge and awareness, improved 
convenience and access to vaccination, mandated vaccination, and 
engaged religious or other influential leaders to promote vaccination.

BOX EC 16.A 
VACCINE COMMUNICATION HIGHLIGHTS
Vaccines are safe and effective, and serious disease can occur if your child and 
family are not immunized.
Vaccine-­hesitant individuals are a heterogeneous group, and their individual 
concerns should be respected and addressed.
Vaccines are tested thoroughly before licensure, and vaccine safety assessment 
networks exist to monitor vaccine safety after licensure.
Nonmedical vaccine exemptions increase rates of unvaccinated children.
Unvaccinated children put vaccinated children and medically exempt children 
who live in that same area at risk.
Pediatricians and other healthcare providers play a major role in educating par-
ents about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines.
Strong provider commitment to vaccination can influence hesitant or resistant par-
ents. Personalizing vaccine acceptance is often an effective approach.
The majority of parents accepted the provider’s vaccine recommendations when 
they were presented as required immunizations to maintain optimal disease 
prevention.
The current vaccine schedule is the only one recommended by the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics 
(AAP). Alternative schedules have not been evaluated.

I.  COMMON NEONATAL AND PEDIATRIC INFECTIONS: GUIDELINES 
FOR DIAGNOSIS AND INITIAL MANAGEMENT
Tables 17.1–17.6 and Figs. 17.1–17.3 present the most common neonatal 
and pediatric infections, organized by site of infection or by organism, when 
applicable. These recommendations are based on national guidelines and 
recent literature. They are not meant to replace clinical judgment.
For recommendations on preliminary identification of bacteria and 
antibiotic selection based on spectrum of activity for commonly used anti-
biotics, please see Sections II–III. Please note that local resistance pattern 
should guide antibiotic selection. Follow published institutional guidelines 
and culture results for individual patients and infections. When possible, 
always use the agent with the narrowest spectrum of activity, particularly 
when organism susceptibilities are known.
A.  Congenital, Perinatal, and Neonatal Infections (Table 17.1)
B.  Pediatric Infections by System (Table 17.2) 
C.  Pediatric Viral Illnesses (Table 17.3)
D.  Pediatric Tick-­Borne Diseases (Table 17.4) 
E.  Tuberculosis: Diagnosis and Treatment (Boxes 17.1 and 17.2)1,2
	1.	 Diagnosis
	
a.	 See Box 17.1 for screening guidelines and Box 17.2 for informa-
tion on interpretation of tuberculin skin tests (TSTs) and interferon 
gamma release assays (IGRAs).
	
b.	 If positive screening test, obtain chest X-­ray.
	
c.	 If symptoms indicate active tuberculosis (TB) disease, determine source.
	
(1)	 Consider pediatric protocol chest CT over X-ray when available.
	
(2)	 Specimen sources include sputum, bronchial washings, gastric 
aspirates (morning aspirate before feeding/ambulation x 3 speci-
mens), pleural fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, tissue biopsy.
	
(3)	 Acid-­fast smear and/or nucleic acid amplification testing may 
provide rapid diagnosis. The latter may also detect rifampin resis-
tance. Solid media culture can take as long as 10 weeks, liquid 
media 1 to 6 weeks.
	
d.	 Lumbar puncture is recommended in children less than 12 months 
with confirmed TB and should be considered in children 12 to 24 
months. (Cont’d on pg. 433.)

CONGENITAL AND PERINATAL INFECTIONS
Cytomegalovirus1
Congenital: 90% asymptomatic at birth. 
IUGR, jaundice, thrombocytopenia, pete-
chiae, hepatosplenomegaly, transaminitis, 
microcephaly, intracranial calcifications, 
sensorineural hearing loss, and retinitis.
Perinatal: sepsis, pneumonitis, hepato-
splenomegaly, transaminitis
Herpes virus.
Congenital infection is 
­transmitted in utero.
Perinatal infection may be 
transmitted via birth canal 
or breastmilk.
PCR or rapid viral culture of saliva, 
urine, blood, sputum, or CSF.
Variable practice of screening infants 
(urine or saliva). May target those 
who fail newborn hearing screen or 
with low birth weight.
Congenital: PO valganciclovir for 6 
months if symptomatic.
Affected infants should have hearing 
tested at regular intervals.
Perinatal: IV ganciclovir for 2–3 weeks. 
Follow CMV serum viral load.
Group B Strep3,48
Early-­onset: 0–6 days, typically within 24 hr. 
Most commonly pneumonia, bacteremia, 
or meningitis.
Late-­onset: 7–89 days, typically 3–4 weeks. 
Most commonly bacteremia or meningitis. 
Also septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, UTI, 
and cellulitis.
Transmitted by mother 
with genitourinary GBS 
colonization OR in setting 
of maternal infection 
(bacteremia, endometritis, 
chorioamnionitis).
Intrapartum antibiotics 
decrease transmission (at 
least 1 dose ≥4 hr prior to 
delivery).
Multiple accepted approaches for 
risk assessment among infants born 
>35 weeks of gestation. Example 
of common, categorical approach 
shown in Fig. 17.1. Newer, multivari-
ate risk assessment (Neonatal Early-
Onset Sepsis Calculator) is available 
at: https://neonatalsepsiscalculator.
kaiserpermanente.org. 
Diagnosis made by culture.
Penicillin G.
Presumptive early-­onset GBS sepsis: 
ampicillin and gentamicin.
Empiric treatment for late-­onset GBS 
meningitis: ampicillin and cefotaxime.
Ceftriaxone if >30 days. Consider inclu-
sion of vancomycin for Streptococcus 
pneumoniae meningitis.
Hepatitis B1
90% of infants infected perinatally or in first 
year of life develop chronic HBV infection, 
leading to:
	1.	
Chronic low-­grade hepatitis
	2.	
Progression to cirrhosis and HCC
	3.	
Risk of reactivation acute hepatitis
Hepadnavirus usually transmit-
ted perinatally (rather than in 
utero), from mother with acute 
or active chronic infection.
95% of transmission prevented 
with appropriate immuno-
prophylaxis at birth.4
If mother HBsAg-­positive, test infant 
for HBsAg and anti-­HBsAg between 
9 and 12 months (or 1–2 months 
after final HBV vaccine).
Monitor HBV DNA and ALT in chronic HBV.
Infection cleared at ∼1% per year.
See Table 17.5 for interpretation of 
serologies.
See Chapter 16 for immunoprophylaxis 
with HBV vaccine and HBIG.
Breastfeeding is safe.
Refer for treatment if active HBV replica-
tion with elevated ALT for 6 months.

NEONATAL INFECTIONS
Fever in infant7,8
Serious bacterial infections (UTI, bacteremia, 
meningitis) are common in febrile infants. 
Risk is significant even if well-appearing 
without a clear source.
Unimmunized infants, premature infants, or 
infants who received antibiotics recently 
are at higher risk for serious bacterial 
infection.
0–28 days: Escherichia coli, 
Klebsiella pneumoniae, GBS. 
Rarely, Listeria.
29+ days: The marked decline 
in invasive infections due to 
Haemophilus influenzae type 
b and S. pneumoniae since 
introduction of conjugate 
vaccines has reduced 
the likelihood of serious 
bacterial infection in this 
age group.
In neonates under 90 days, 
vast majority of bacterial 
infections are UTIs.
Ill-­appearing infant or <28 days, 
require full sepsis workup and 
admission.
Goal with well-­appearing infants >28 
days is identifying those who can 
be safely discharged and monitored 
as outpatient with or without 
antibiotics.
Well-­established algorithms often 
rely on the Rochester, Philadelphia, 
and Boston criteria. Step-­by-­Step 
approach is a newer model that 
is also generally accepted. Our 
approach is outlined in Fig. 17.2.
Empiric therapy:
0–28 days: ampicillin + gentamicin 
or cefotaxime when meningitis is 
suspected. Add acyclovir as clinically 
indicated.
29+ days: ceftriaxone
In well-­appearing infants with negative 
cultures, treatment and admission 
can be shortened to 24–36 hr (blood 
cultures positive by 24 hr in 91% of 
cases of bacteremia7).
Macrolide antibiotic if confirmed chla-
mydia pneumonia.

In most cases there is no need for 
antibiotics. Azithromycin × 3 
days or ciprofloxacin × 3 days if 
severe or prolonged (>7 days); 
no antibiotics for STEC O157:H7, 
as antibiotics increase risk of 
hemolytic uremic syndrome.27

Helicobacter pylori29
Chronic gastritis, duodenal ulcer. Can 
often be asymptomatic. Warning signs 
include severe chronic abdominal 
pain, anorexia and failure to thrive, or 
persistent vomiting.
Sequelae: iron deficiency anemia, 
short stature, and chronic immune 
thrombocytopenia.
Fecal-­oral transmission.
Up to 80% prevalent in resource-­poor 
countries.
Diagnosis should aim to find the 
underlying cause of symptoms and 
not solely look for H. pylori infection.
Diagnostic testing for H. pylori not 
recommended in children with 
functional abdominal pain.
Gold standard: gastric biopsy 
with culture (also yields 
susceptibilities).
Test of cure (stool EIA or urea breath 
test) 4–6 weeks after treatment.
Triple therapy: PPI + amoxicillin + 
clarithromycin × 14 days.
Subsequent regimens should be 
guided by susceptibilities. If none 
are available, PPI + amoxicillin 
+ metronidazole +/− bismuth × 
14 days.
GENITOURINARY
Cystitis (UTI)30
Dysuria, urgency, fever of unknown source.
Foul smelling urine is not sensitive for UTI.
Risk factors for infants less than 2 
years:
Nonblack
Temp >39°C
Uncircumcised
Fever >2 days
Young age (<12 mo if female, <6 mo 
if male)
E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, 
Enterococcus faecalis.
The following are not considered 
pathogens in healthy children:
Lactobacillus spp, coagulase-­
negative staphylococci, and 
Corynebacterium spp.
Diagnosis requires pyuria (≥10 
WBCs/hpf or positive leukocyte 
esterase) and culture of ≥50,000 
colony forming units for infants 
and children and ≥100,000 for 
adolescents.
In infants, bagged urine specimen 
can be used for screening urinaly-
sis, and if positive, should send 
catheterized sample for culture 
and repeat urinalysis.
PO cephalexin or nitrofurantoin: 3 
days (7 days if <2 years).
In young (<2 years) patients with 1st 
time UTI: renal bladder ultrasound; 
VCUG if abnormal.
There is controversy around the timing 
of VCUG. AAP guidelines support 
waiting until second UTI. AAP Section 
on urology (based on RIVUR study) 
supports VCUG after 1st febrile UTI.31

large joint).
Neisseria gonorrhoeae (adolescents 
with migratory arthritis).
Kocher criteria used to differenti-
ate septic joint from transient 
synovitis. Designed for hips, but 
often applied to knee/ankle.
If 3 of 4 criteria met, 93% chance of 
septic joint:
	1.	
Non–weight bearing
	2.	
Fever
	3.	
ESR >40 mm/hr
	4.	
WBC >12,000/mm3
If criteria met or high-­risk:
Knee—X-­ray
Hip—ultrasound.
Joint aspiration suggests septic 
arthritis if >50,000 WBC/mm3.
For Lyme disease: two-tier test with 
serology and confirmation western 
blot and/or PCR from joint fluid.
Early drainage relieves discomfort, 
prevents synovial damage.
Consider empiric coverage based on 
local resistance patterns. For chil-
dren <5 years: cefazolin or oxacillin 
± TMP/SMX. For children >5 years: 
cefazolin or oxacillin or clindamycin 
or TMP/SMX.
If unstable or ill-appearing, IV 
vancomycin.
Duration 3-4 weeks for acute 
infection.

Adapted from Tunkel 2004. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid is necessary to differentiate various types of meningitis. Initial 
studies such as cell counts and gram stain can be helpful, but culture of cerebrospinal fluid remains diagnostic. Opening 
pressure is generally in the range of 200 to 500 mm H2O, although values may be lower in neonates, infants, and children 
with acute bacterial meningitis.
	2.	 Treatment of latent TB infection (Cont’d from pg. 408)
	
a.	 Rule out active TB.
	
b.	 Treatment regimens
	
(1)	 12 weeks of weekly isoniazid and rifapentine if above 2 years.
	
(2)	 9 months of isoniazid daily.
	
(3)	 Rifampin daily for 4 months (preferred regimen if 
isoniazid-­resistant).
	
c.	 If young (<4 years) or immunocompromised, treat recent contacts of 
people with active TB, even if testing (TST/IGRA) is negative. Some 
experts would discontinue treatment if repeat testing is negative at 
8-12 weeks.
	3.	 Treatment of active TB
	
a.	 High rates of resistance in endemic countries. Treatment should be 
initiated in consultation with an infectious disease specialist.

434    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	
b.	 Pulmonary TB: 6-month regimen, including 2 months RIPE 
(rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol), followed by 4 
months of rifampin/isoniazid.
	
c.	 Extra-pulmonary or drug-resistant TB: Consult infectious disease 
specialist.
	
d.	 Pyridoxine supplementation if breastfed, meat-­/milk-­deficient diet, 
symptomatic HIV, or pregnant.
F.  Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Acquired Immunodeficiency 
Syndrome
Please see the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines on the diagno-
sis and management of children with HIV infection at www.aidsinfo.nih.gov/ 
for the most up-­to-­date recommendations.
	1.	 Diagnosis
	
a.	 Perinatal: See Table 17.8 for diagnosis in perinatal period.37
	
b.	 Infants and children38: HIV nucleic acid testing must be used under 
18 months to avoid confounding from maternal antibodies. Antigen/
antibody testing can be performed after 18 months. If concern 
for breastmilk exposure, test immediately, then at 4 to 6 weeks, 3 
months, and 6 months after stopping breastfeeding.
	
c.	 Adolescents39: HIV screening with fourth-­generation antigen/antibody 
assay with opt-­out consent as part of routine clinical care. If positive, 
confirm with HIV-­1/HIV-­2 immunoassay; if indeterminate, HIV-­1 
nucleic acid testing.
	2.	 Management37–40
	
a.	 See Table 17.7 for management during perinatal period.
	
b.	 Initiation of therapy for all children with HIV is recommended by 
the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Panel on 
Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents and the World 
Health Organization (WHO).
	
c.	 Therapy: Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) of at least three 
drugs from at least two different classes. Go to http://www.aidsinfo.
nih.gov/ for most current therapy recommendations.
	3.	 Monitoring38
	
a.	 At diagnosis: CD4 count, plasma HIV RNA viral load, genotype resis-
tance. If starting therapy, HLA-­B*5701 (screening for hypersensitivity 
to abacavir) and hepatitis B serology.
	
b.	 Follow-­up not on ART: Every 3 to 4 months, CD4 count, plasma HIV 
RNA viral load, CBC with differential, complete metabolic panel with 
glucose, renal function, albumin, transaminases, lipid panel. Every 6 
to 12 months, obtain urinalysis to evaluate for nephropathy.
	
c.	 Follow-­up on ART: At 2 to 4 weeks after initiation or switching 
therapy, CD4, viral load, and labs according to possible toxicities of 
ART. Then similar testing as above every 3 to 4 months.
	
d.	 Once viral suppression achieved, CD4 improved, good adherence, and 
otherwise stable for 2 to 3 years, can space labs to every 6 to 12 months.
	
e.	 Latent TB skin testing starting at age 3 to 12 months, and then annually.

BOX 17.1
TUBERCULOSIS SCREENING GUIDELINES1,41
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends treatment for at-­risk individu-
als. Clinicians should complete at-­risk assessment questionnaire at first well-­child 
visit, then every 6 months in 1st year of life, and then routine care (at least annu-
ally). Screening questions include:
 • 
Born outside the United States in countries with endemic infection
 • 
Traveled outside United States in countries with endemic infection
 • 
Family member with positive tuberculin skin test (TST)
 • 
Exposed to someone who had tuberculosis disease
 • 
Special populations including children with HIV, organ transplant, and those on 
immunosuppressive therapies including tumor necrosis factor blockers/antagonists
	
f.	 Vaccines1 (see Chapter 16 and Red Book for details):
	
(1)	 Meningococcal conjugate ACWY (can start at 2 months; 2 or 4 
doses depending on age).
	
(2)	 23-­valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine at 2 years.
	
(3)	 MMR can be given if CD4 >15% (any age) and CD4 count > 200 
lymphocytes/mm3 (if >5 years).
	
(4)	 Some experts would consider monovalent varicella vaccine for children 
>12 months with CD4 >15%. Combined MMRV should not be given.

BOX 17.2
DEFINITIONS OF POSITIVE TUBERCULIN SKIN TESTING1
Induration ≥5 mm
 • 
Children in close contact with known or suspected contagious cases of 
tuberculosis
 • 
Children suspected to have tuberculosis based on clinical or radiographic findings
 • 
Children on immunosuppressive therapy or with immunosuppressive condi-
tions (including HIV infection) 
Induration ≥10 mm
 • 
Children at increased risk for dissemination based on young age (<4 years) or 
with other medical conditions (cancer, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, 
or malnutrition)
 • 
Children with increased exposure: Those born in or whose parents were born 
in endemic countries; those with travel to endemic countries; those exposed 
to HIV-­infected adults, homeless persons, illicit drug users, nursing home 
residents, or incarcerated or institutionalized persons 
Induration ≥15 mm
 • 
Children ≥4 years without any risk factors
A tuberculin skin testing (TST) should be read in 48 to 72 hours. The measles vaccine can 
suppress TST reactivity for 4 to 6 weeks. An interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) can be 
used instead of TST in children older than 2 years. It has a higher specificity than TST because 
antigens used are not found in Bacillus Calmette-­Guérin (BCG) vaccine or most pathogenic 
nontuberculous mycobacteria.

DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT FOR INFANTS WITH IN UTERO HIV EXPOSURE
Age
Laboratory Testsa
Next Steps
Prenatal/Labor
Opt-­out testing of all pregnant 
women.
HIV antibody testing in third 
trimester, before 36 weeks 
gestation preferred.
Rapid HIV testing with confirmation 
if unknown HIV status during labor.
Start ART in mother.
If viral load RNA >1000 copies/mL or 
unknown at labor, start IV zidovudine 
(ZDV) and consider cesarean section if 
greater than 38 weeks gestation.
Newborn
HIV nucleic acid test (DNA or RNA) 
if maternal status unknown, or 
high risk of infection.
Baseline CBC with differential.
Start ZDV within 6–12 hr of delivery. 
If low-risk, continue ZDV for 4 weeks.
If maternal viral load detectable and <1000 
copies/mL near delivery, give nevirapine 
x 3 doses (within 48hr of birth, 48hr 
after first dose, 96hr after second dose). 
Continue zidovudine for 6 weeks. Some 
experts add lamivudine for 1 week.
If mother did not receive antepartum ART 
or has acute/primary HIV in the 3rd 
trimester or has viral load >1000 copies/
mL near delivery, start empiric ART 
with zidovudine, lamivudine, and either 
nevirapine or raltegravir.
2–3 weeks
HIV nucleic acid test (DNA or RNA).
CBC with differential.
Check ZDV dosing and administration.
Assess psychosocial needs, consider case 
management referral.
4–6 weeks
HIV nucleic acid test (DNA or RNA).
CBC with differential.
Discontinue ZDV monotherapy regardless 
of PCR result (ZDV monotherapy is used 
during first 6 weeks for prophylaxis only). If 
positive, start ART according to guidelines.
Presumptively exclude HIV infection if 
results of ≥2 weeks PCR and ≥4 weeks 
PCR both negative. No TMP-­SMX needed.
If PCR results not yet known, begin 
Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophy-
laxis, such as TMP-­SMX.
2 months
Discontinue TMP-­SMX if DNA or RNA testing 
negative.
4–6 months
HIV nucleic acid test (DNA or RNA).
Definitively exclude HIV infection: two negative 
PCRs at ≥1 month and ≥4 months, as long 
as no signs/symptoms of HIV infection.
18–24 months
Antibody testing may be performed 
to confirm clearance of maternal 
HIV antibodies. If present, need 
to use nucleic acid testing.
aAny abnormal result requires prompt pediatric HIV specialist consultation.
ART, Antiretroviral therapy; CBC, complete blood cell count; DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid; HIV, human immunodeficiency 
virus; IV, intravenous; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RNA, ribonucleic acid; TMP-­SMX, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole; 
ZDV, zidovudine.

(3)	 Descovy and Truvada are FDA-approved for adolescents > 35kg. 
Descovy is not approved to prevent transmission via vaginal sex.
	
c.	 Follow-­up
	
(1)	 Every 3 months: HIV test and syphilis/gonorrhea/chlamydia if 
patient is symptomatic, engaging in anal intercourse, has prior 
history of STIs, or has multiple partners. Counsel on condom use 
at every visit.
	
(2)	 Every 6 months: Same as above, plus routine STI screening 
(including oral and/or anal testing, if applicable) and renal function.
	5.	 Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)42,43
	
a.	 Indications for occupational PEP: Consider with percutaneous, 
mucosal, or skin exposure to blood or bodily fluids from a patient 
with known HIV or in whom there is high suspicion. See Section IV. 
for further non-HIV details.
	
b.	 Indications for nonoccupational (nPEP): Unprotected vaginal/anal 
intercourse, oral sex with ejaculation or blood exposure, needle shar-
ing, or injuries with blood exposure from an individual with known 
HIV or unknown status.
	
c.	 Labs: 4th-generation HIV test, HBV surface antigen and antibody, 
HCV antibody. Depending on exposure, consider tetanus prophylaxis 
and STI testing.
	
d.	 Regimen: Initiate as soon as possible (lower likelihood of efficacy at 
greater than 72 hours); three-­drug (or more) ART regimen for 28 
days. Regimen: tenofovir and emtricitabine with raltegravir. For nPEP, 
dolutegravir may be used instead of raltegravir. Consult infectious 
disease expert for any initiation of PEP.
	
e.	 Follow-­up testing can occur at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months; for 
occupational exposures, if 4th-­generation testing available, follow-­up 
testing can be done at 6 weeks and 4 months.
	
f.	 Clinicians’ PEP Line: 1-888-448-4911. 
II.  MICROBIOLOGY
A.  Collection of Specimens for Blood Culture
	1.	 Preparation: To minimize contamination, clean venipuncture site with 
70% isopropyl ethyl alcohol. Apply tincture of iodine or 10% povidone-­
iodine and allow skin to dry for at least 1 minute, or scrub site with 2% 
chlorhexidine for 30 seconds and allow skin to dry for 30 seconds. 
Clean blood culture bottle injection site with alcohol only.
	2.	 Collection: Two sets of cultures from two different sites of equal blood 
volume should be obtained for each febrile episode, based on patient 
weight: less than 8 kg, 1 to 3 mL; 8 to 13 kg, 4 to 5 mL; 14 to 25 kg, 
5 to 6 mL; greater than 25 kg, 10 mL. Peripheral sites preferred. If 
concern for central line infection, collect one from central access site, 
second from peripheral. Consider anaerobe blood cultures if concern 
for the following: head and neck infections, intra-­abdominal infections, 
immunodeficiency, trauma or pressure sore.44,45

III.  SPECTRA OF ACTIVITY FOR COMMONLY USED ANTIBIOTICS (FIG. 17.6)
IV.  EXPOSURES TO BLOOD BORNE PATHOGENS AND PROPHYLAXIS
A.  General Practice46
	1.	 Regardless of status of patient, if you experience a needlestick or splash 
exposure, immediately wash with soap/water, irrigate, report to supervi-
sor, and seek medical assistance.
	2.	 There is an increased risk of transmission with larger volume of blood, 
prolonged exposure, high viral titer, deep injury, or if patient has 
advanced disease.
	3.	 Source should be tested for HIV, hepatitis C antibody, and hepatitis B 
surface antigen. Exposed person should be tested for HIV, hepatitis C 
antibody, hepatitis B surface antibody, and hepatitis B surface antigen. 
B.  Disease-­Specific Post-Exposure Management
	1.	 Hepatitis B47: High risk of transmission if surface antigen and e-antigen 
positive. Lower risk of transmission if surface antigen positive, e-antigen 
negative. Post-exposure management includes hepatitis B immune 
globulin and initiation of hepatitis B vaccine series, depending on 
immune status. For details, see Chapter 16.
	2.	 Hepatitis C47: Lower risk of transmission. No preventative therapy is currently 
recommended, but this is an evolving field. Follow-­up testing essential.
	3.	 See Section I.F for information on post-exposure management for HIV.

I.  NEWBORN RESUSCITATION
A.  Algorithm for Neonatal Resuscitation (Fig. 18.1)
	1.	 Essential functional equipment: Radiant warmer, prewarmed blankets, 
hat, bag-­mask/NeoPIP ventilator, appropriately sized laryngoscope, 
appropriately sized endotracheal tube (ETT) +/−stylet, suction device 
and bulb syringe, emergency medications, and vascular access supplies.
	2.	 Meconium stained fluids: Per Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) 
7th edition, routine intrapartum oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal suction-
ing and endotracheal intubation are not recommended.2
	3.	 Cord clamping should be delayed for at least 30 to 60 seconds for 
vigorous term and preterm infants, given no maternal or fetal indica-
tions for immediate clamping.3 See Box EC 18.A for exclusions. 
There is insufficient evidence to support or refute use of umbilical 
cord milking. 
B.  Endotracheal Tube Size and Depth of Insertion (Table 18.1)
	1.	 Quick estimations:
	
a.	 ETT size: 2.5 mm for infants <30 weeks gestational age (wGA); 3.0 
mm for 30 to 34 wGA; 3.5 mm for >35 wGA.
	
b.	 ETT depth: Infant’s weight (kg) + 6 cm 
C.  Vascular Access (See Chapter 4 for Umbilical Venous/Artery 
Catheter Placement)
NOTE: During the initial resuscitation, an umbilical venous catheter (UVC) 
should be inserted just far enough to obtain blood return; no measurement 
or verified placement is needed. 
II.  ROUTINE NEWBORN CARE OF A TERM INFANT
A.  General Care for the Full-­Term Healthy Newborn with 
Uncomplicated Delivery
NOTE: Protocols vary by hospital.
	1.	 Drying, removal of wet blankets. Then, preferably skin-­to-­skin contact 
with mother4 or otherwise placed under warmer.
	2.	 Feeding: Preferably breastfeeding soon after birth and on demand 
thereafter. Breastfed newborns should feed 8 to 12 times daily. 
Formula-­fed newborns should be offered a bottle soon after birth.

	3.	 Vitamin K injection for prevention of hemorrhagic disease of the 
newborn.
	4.	 Antibiotic ophthalmic ointment for prophylaxis against gonococcal 
infection.
	5.	 Monitor clinically for jaundice, accounting for newborn’s risk factors for 
hyperbilirubinemia. Transcutaneous bilirubin monitoring may be useful 
as a screening tool but does not replace plasma level.5 Obtain plasma 
bilirubin level if warranted. See Section IX for more information and 
management.
	6.	 Consider blood glucose monitoring if infant is at increased risk or is 
symptomatic of hypoglycemia (see Fig. 18.2 for management).
	7.	 Monitor for stool/urine output. Most infants should have 1 void and 1 
meconium stool within first 24 hours.6
	8.	 Monitor for excessive weight loss. 
B.  Prior to Discharge7
	1.	 Newborn metabolic screening: First screen typically performed within 
first 72 hours of life, at least 24 hours after initiation of feeding (see 
Chapter 13).
	2.	 Vaccinations: Hepatitis B vaccine (see Chapter 16).
	3.	 Critical congenital heart disease screening: Measure pre-­ and/or post-
ductal oxygen saturation (see Chapter 7).
	4.	 Newborn hearing screening.
	5.	 Document red reflex.
	6.	 Establish primary care.

	1.	 Posture: Observe infant quiet and supine. Score 0 for arms, legs 
extended; 1 for starting to flex hips and knees, arms extended; 2 for 
stronger flexion of legs, arms extended; 3 for arms slightly flexed, legs 
flexed and abducted; and 4 for full flexion of arms and legs.
	2.	 Square window: Flex hand on forearm enough to obtain fullest possible 
flexion without wrist rotation. Measure angle between hypothenar emi-
nence and ventral aspect of forearm.
	3.	 Arm recoil: With infant supine, flex forearms for 5 seconds, fully extend 
by pulling on hands, then release. Measure the angle of elbow flexion to 
which arms recoil.
	4.	 Popliteal angle: Hold infant supine with pelvis flat, thigh held in knee-­
chest position. Extend leg by gentle pressure and measure popliteal 
angle.
	5.	 Scarf sign: With baby supine, pull infant’s hand across the neck toward 
opposite shoulder. Determine how far elbow will reach across. Score 0 
if elbow reaches opposite axillary line, 1 if past midaxillary line, 2 if past 
midline, and 3 if elbow unable to reach midline.
	6.	 Heel-­to-­ear maneuver: With baby supine, draw foot as near to head as 
possible without forcing it. Observe distance between foot and head 
and degree of extension at knee.

B.  Glucose
	1.	 Glucose infusion rate (GIR): Preterm neonates require approximately 5 
to 6 mg/kg/min of glucose (40 to 100 mg/dL).9 Term neonates require 
approximately 3 to 5 mg/kg/min of glucose. Calculate as follows:
GIR (mg/kg/min)= 0.167 × [ % dextrose concentration] infusion rate

/[Weight (kg)]
	2.	 Management of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia: Table 18.5 and  
Fig. 18.2 (see Chapters 1 and 10). 
C.  Electrolytes, Minerals, and Vitamins
	1.	 Electrolyte requirements (Table 18.6)
	2.	 Mineral and vitamin requirements:
	
a.	 Infants born at <34 weeks gestation have higher calcium, 
phosphorus, sodium, iron, and vitamin D requirements and 
require breastmilk fortifier or special preterm formulas with iron. 
Fortifier is generally added to breast milk after the 2nd week of 
life.
	
b.	 Iron: Preterm infants tolerating full enteral feeds require an elemental 
iron supplementation of 2 to 4 mg/kg/day. Timing of initiation remains 
controversial, generally after age 2 weeks.
	
c.	 Vitamin D: Infants fed breast milk without fortifier require 400 IU 
daily. Infants fed preterm formula require 200 IU/day. Infants fed full 
term formula should be supplemented 400 IU/day until consuming 1 
liter daily.
	
d.	 ADEK: Indicated for infants with malabsorption and/or cholestasis 
tolerating full enteral feeds. 
D.  Nutrition
	1.	 Growth and caloric requirements: Table 18.7

Evaluation
Assess for symptoms and calculate glucose delivery to infant.
Confirm bedside glucose with laboratory serum glucose.
Consider other laboratory evaluations: Complete blood cell count with differential; 
electrolytes; blood, urine, ±cerebrospinal fluid cultures; urinalysis; insulin and 
C-­peptide levels.
Management
See Fig. 18.3. If glucose <40 and symp-
tomatic, treat with intravenous glucose 
(dose = 200 mg/kg, which is equivalent to 
dextrose 10% at 2 mL/kg). Change dextrose 
infusion rates gradually. Generally, no more 
than 2 mg/kg/min in a 2-­hr interval (see 
Chapter 1) .
Gradually decrease glucose 
infusion rate if receiving >5 mg/
kg/min
Monitor glucosuria. Consider 
insulin infusion for persistent 
hyperglycemia.
Monitor glucose levels every 30–60 min until normal.

V.  CYANOSIS IN THE NEWBORN
A.  Differential Diagnosis
	1.	 General: Hypothermia, hypoglycemia, sepsis
	2.	 Cardiac: Congestive heart failure, congenital cyanotic heart disease
	3.	 Respiratory: Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn 
(PPHN), diaphragmatic hernia, pulmonary hypoplasia, choanal atresia, 
pneumothorax, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), TTN, pneumonia, 
meconium aspiration
	4.	 Neurologic: Central apnea, central hypoventilation, intraventricular 
hemorrhage (IVH), meningitis
	5.	 Hematologic: Polycythemia, methemoglobinemia
	6.	 Medications: Respiratory depression from maternal medications (e.g., 
magnesium sulfate, narcotics, general anesthesia) 
B.  Evaluation
	1.	 Physical examination: Note central vs. peripheral and persistent vs. 
intermittent cyanosis, respiratory effort, single vs. split S2, presence of 
heart murmur. Acrocyanosis is often a normal finding in newborns.
	2.	 Clinical tests: Hyperoxia test (see Chapter 7) , preductal/postductal arte-
rial blood gases or pulse oximetry to assess for right-­to-­left shunt, and 
transillumination of chest for possible pneumothorax.
	3.	 Other data: Complete blood cell count (CBC) with differential, serum 
glucose, chest radiograph, electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiography. 
Consider blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid cultures if sepsis is suspected 
and methemoglobin level if cyanosis is out of proportion to hypoxemia. 
VI.  RESPIRATORY DISEASES
A.  General Respiratory Considerations
	1.	 Exogenous surfactant therapy:
	
a.	 Indications: RDS in preterm infants, meconium aspiration, pneumo-
nia, persistent pulmonary hypertension.
	
b.	 Administration: If infant is ≤26 weeks gestation, first dose is typically 
given in delivery room or as soon as stabilized; repeat dosing can be 
considered based on ongoing oxygen requirements and level of respira-
tory support.
	
c.	 Complications: Pneumothorax, pulmonary hemorrhage.
	2.	 Supplemental O2: Adjust inspired oxygen to maintain O2 saturation. Ideal 
target oxygen saturations vary based on factors such as gestational 
age, chronologic age, and underlying conditions, and aims to minimize 
adverse outcomes from hypoxemia and hyperoxemia. Higher targets 
(>94%) can be used when the retinas are mature (see Section XIII) and 
in cases of pulmonary hypertension.10 
B.  Respiratory Distress Syndrome
	1.	 Etiology: Deficiency of pulmonary surfactant resulting in increased sur-
face tension and alveolar collapse. Surfactant is produced in increasing 
quantities after 32 weeks gestation.
 

--- Page 591 ---
456    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	2.	 Prevention:
	
a.	 Antenatal maternal administration of steroids >24 hours and <7 days 
prior to delivery, has been shown to decrease neonatal morbidity and 
mortality.11-­14
	
(1)	 Generally, either two doses of betamethasone administered 24 
hours apart or four doses of dexamethasone given every 12 hours.
	
(2)	 A single repeat course considered in women <34 weeks gestation 
and whose previous steroid course was administered >14 days 
prior. Serial courses not currently recommended.
	
b.	 Other factors that accelerate lung maturity include maternal hyper-
tension, sickle cell disease, narcotic addiction, intrauterine growth 
retardation, prolonged rupture of the membranes, and fetal stress.
	3.	 Incidence: Table 18.8
	4.	 Risk factors: Prematurity, maternal diabetes, cesarean section without 
antecedent labor, perinatal asphyxia, second twin, previous infant with RDS.
	5.	 Clinical presentation:
	
a.	 Respiratory distress worsens during first few hours of life, progresses 
over 48 to 72 hours, and subsequently improves.
	
b.	 Recovery is accompanied by brisk diuresis.
	
c.	 See Chapter 26 for imaging findings.
	6.	 Management:
	
a.	 Ventilatory and oxygenation support
	
b.	 Surfactant therapy 
C.  Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn
	1.	 Etiology: Idiopathic or secondary to conditions leading to increased 
pulmonary vascular resistance. PPHN is most commonly seen in term 
or postterm infants, infants born by cesarean section, and infants with a 
history of fetal distress and low APGAR scores. It usually presents within 
12 to 24 hours of birth:
	
a.	 Vasoconstriction secondary to hypoxemia and acidosis
	
b.	 Interstitial pulmonary disease (meconium aspiration syndrome, 
pneumonia)
	
c.	 Hyperviscosity syndrome (polycythemia)

d.	 Pulmonary hypoplasia, either primary or secondary to congenital 
diaphragmatic hernia or renal agenesis
	2.	 Diagnostic features:
	
a.	 Severe hypoxemia (Pao2 <35 to 45 mmHg in 100% O2) dispropor-
tionate to radiologic changes.
	
b.	 Structurally normal heart with right-­to-­left shunt at foramen ovale 
and/or ductus arteriosus; pre/postductal oxygenation gradient (≥7 to 
15 mmHg is significant).
	
c.	 Must be distinguished from cyanotic heart disease. Infants with cya-
notic heart disease will have an abnormal cardiac examination and 
show little to no improvement in oxygen therapy or hyperventilation. 
See Chapter 7 for interpretation of hyperoxia test.
	3.	 Principles of therapy:
	
a.	 Improve oxygenation: Supplemental oxygen administration and optimi-
zation of oxygen-­carrying capacity with blood transfusions as indicated.
	
b.	 Minimize pulmonary vasoconstriction:
	
(1)	 Minimal handling of infant or noxious procedures. Sedation and 
occasionally paralysis of intubated neonates may be necessary.
	
(2)	 Avoid severe hyperventilation associated hypocarbia (PCO2 <30 
mmHg), which can be associated with myocardial ischemia and 
decreased cerebral blood flow. Hyperventilation may result in 
barotrauma and predispose to chronic lung disease. Consider 
high-­frequency ventilation.
	
c.	 Maintenance of systemic blood pressure and perfusion: Reversal of 
right-­to-­left shunt through volume expanders and/or inotropes.
	
d.	 Consider pulmonary vasodilator therapy: see Chapter 1
	
(1)	 Inhaled nitric oxide (NO): Reduces pulmonary vascular resistance 
(PVR). Typical starting dose is 20 parts per million (ppm). Unlikely 
to have additional benefit at >40 ppm. Complications include met-
hemoglobinemia (reduce NO dose for methemoglobin >4%), NO2 
poisoning (reduce NO dose for NO2 concentration >1 to 2 ppm).
	
(2)	 Prostacyclin analog (e.g., epoprostenol): Pulmonary vasodilator, 
normally produced by lung when lung vessels are constricted.
	
(3)	 Sildenafil: Cyclic cGMP-­specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) 
inhibitor; results in pulmonary vasodilation.
	
e.	 Broad-­spectrum antibiotics: Sepsis is a common underlying cause of 
PPHN.
	f.	 Consider extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO): Reserved for 
cases of severe cardiovascular instability, oxygenation index (OI) >40 
for >3 hour, or alveolar-­arterial gradient (A-­aO2) ≥610 for 8 hours (see 
Chapter 1 for OI and A-­a gradient equations). Infants typically need 
to be >2000 g and at >34 weeks gestation to be ECMO candidates. 
Obtain head ultrasound and consider EEG before initiating ECMO.
	4.	 Mortality depends on underlying diagnosis: Mortality rates are gener-
ally lower for RDS and meconium aspiration, but higher in sepsis and 
diaphragmatic hernia.

458    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
D.  Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn
	1.	 Etiology: Incomplete or delayed resorption of amniotic fluid from the 
lungs.
	
a.	 Immaturity of respiratory epithelial Na+ transport.
	2.	 Risk factors: Birth by cesarean section, male sex, macrosomia, 
lower gestational age, maternal diabetes, maternal asthma, maternal 
smoking.
	3.	 Diagnostic features:
	
a.	 Symptoms present within first 6 hours of delivery and resolve within 
first postnatal week, usually within 72 hours.
	
b.	 Tachypnea: greater than 60 breaths/min, often in the range of 80 to 
100 breaths/min.
	
c.	 Retractions, grunting, or nasal flaring may be present. Cyanosis and 
hypoxia rare.
	
d.	 CXR consistent with retained fluid: congestion, perihilar streaking, 
fluid in the interlobar fissure.
	
e.	 Exclusion of other diagnoses, i.e. pneumonia, aspiration, congeni-
tal malformations, subarachnoid hemorrhage, hypoxic-­ischemic 
encephalopathy (HIE), pneumothorax, acidosis, RDS.
	4.	 Management:
	
a.	 NPO with gavage feedings or 10% dextrose-­containing fluids via IV.
	
b.	 Supplemental oxygen and/or CPAP as indicated.
	
c.	 No proven benefit of adjuncts including diuretics or racemic 
epinephrine. 
E.  Pneumothorax
	1.	 Seen in 1% to 2% of normal newborns.
	2.	 Associated with use of high ventilatory pressures and underlying dis-
eases such as RDS, meconium aspiration, and pneumonia.
	3.	 Consider monitoring in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).
	4.	 Consider needle thoracostomy or chest tube placement (see Chapter 4). 
VII.  APNEA AND BRADYCARDIA
A.  Apnea15
	1.	 Definition: Respiratory pause >20 seconds or a shorter pause associated 
with cyanosis, pallor, hypotonia, or bradycardia <100 bpm. May be central 
(no diaphragmatic activity), obstructive (upper airway obstruction), or 
mixed.
	2.	 Etiology: See Fig. 18.4. Apnea of prematurity occurs in most infants 
born at <28 weeks gestation, ∼50% of infants born at 30 to 32 weeks 
gestation, and <7% of infants born at 34 to 35 weeks gestation. Usually 
resolves by 34 to 36 weeks postmenstrual age, but may persist after 
term in infants born at <25 weeks gestation.
	3.	 Management:
	
a.	 Consider pathologic causes for apnea (e.g., meningitis, seizures).
	
b.	 Pharmacotherapy with caffeine or other stimulants.
 

--- Page 594 ---
Chapter 18  Neonatology    459
18
	
c.	 Continuous positive airway pressure or mechanical ventilation (see 
Chapter 1). 
B.  Bradycardia without Central Apnea
Etiologies include obstructive apnea, mechanical airway obstruction, gas-
troesophageal reflux, increased intracranial pressure, increased vagal tone 
(defecation, yawning, rectal stimulation, and placement of nasogastric [NG] 
tube), electrolyte abnormalities, heart block. 
VIII.  CARDIAC DISEASES
A.  Patent Ductus Arteriosus
	1.	 Definition: Failure of ductus arteriosus to close in first 72 hours of life 
or reopening after functional closure. Typically results in left-­to-­right 
shunting of blood once PVR has decreased. If PVR remains high, blood 
may be shunted right to left, resulting in hypoxemia (see Section VI.C).
	2.	 Epidemiology: Up to 60% in preterm infants weighing <1500 g and 
higher in those weighing <1000 g. Female-­to-­male ratio is 2:1.
	3.	 Diagnosis:
	
a.	 Examination: Systolic murmur may be continuous and best heard 
at the left upper sternal border or left infraclavicular area. Bounding 
peripheral pulses with widened pulse pressure if large shunt. 
Hyperactive precordium and palmar pulses may be present.
	
b.	 ECG: Normal or left ventricular hypertrophy in small to moderate pat-
ent ductus arteriosus (PDA); biventricular hypertrophy in large PDA.
	
c.	 Chest radiograph: May show cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary 
vascular markings, depending on size of shunt.

d.	 Echocardiogram
	4.	 Management:
	
a.	 Indications for treatment, timing of intervention, and best manage-
ment strategy remain controversial.16,17
	
b.	 Indomethacin/Ibuprofen: Prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor; 80% 
closure rate in preterm infants
	
(1)	 Ibuprofen is as effective as indomethacin but fewer renal adverse 
effects.18
	
(2)	 Complications16-­18: Transient decrease in glomerular filtra-
tion rate and decreased urine output, transient gastroin-
testinal bleeding (no increased incidence of necrotizing 
enterocolitis [NEC]), prolonged bleeding time, and disturbed 
platelet function for 7 to 9 days independent of platelet 
count (no increased incidence of intracranial hemorrhage). 
Spontaneous isolated intestinal perforations are seen with 
indomethacin use. Rates are higher with concomitant hydro-
cortisone use.
	
c.	 Acetaminophen19-­22: Insufficient evidence but thought to be as effec-
tive as indomethacin/ibuprofen without effects on the kidneys and 
platelets.
	
d.	 Surgical ligation of the duct.
B. Cyanotic Heart Disease (See Chapter 7) 
IX.  HEMATOLOGIC DISEASES
A.  Unconjugated Hyperbilirubinemia in the Newborn23
	1.	 Overview:
	
a.	 During first 3 to 4 days of life, total serum bilirubin (TSB) increases to 
6.5 ± 2.5 mg/dL.
	
b.	 Maximum rate of bilirubin increase for normal infants with nonhemo-
lytic hyperbilirubinemia: 5 mg/dL/24 hr or 0.2 mg/dL/hr.
	
c.	 Always consider clinical jaundice or TSB >5 mg/dL on first day of life 
pathologic.
	
d.	 Risk factors: Birth weight <2500 g, exclusive breastfeeding, prema-
turity, ABO incompatibility, cephalohematoma or significant bruising, 
predischarge bilirubin in high-­risk zone, observed jaundice in first 24 
hours, gestational age 35 to 36 weeks, infant of a diabetic mother, 
previous sibling requiring phototherapy, low albumin, infection, race.
	2.	 Evaluation:
	
a.	 Maternal prenatal testing: ABO and Rh (D) typing and serum screen 
for isoimmune antibodies.
	
b.	 Infant or cord blood: Blood and Rh typing (if maternal blood type 
is O, Rh negative, or prenatal blood typing was not performed). 
Consider hemoglobin, blood smear, glucose-­6-­phosphate dehydroge-
nase (GPD) testing, direct Coombs test.

Chapter 18  Neonatology    461
18
	3.	 Management:
	
a.	 Phototherapy: Ideally, intensive phototherapy should produce a TSB 
decline of 1 to 2 mg/dL within 4 to 6 hours, with further subsequent 
decline. Guidelines:
	
(1)	 Preterm newborn (Table 18.9)
	
(2)	 Term newborn (Fig. 18.5)
	
b.	 Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (>35 weeks gestational age): In 
isoimmune hemolytic disease, IVIG administration (0.5 to 1 g/kg over 
2 hours) is recommended if TSB is rising despite intensive photo-
therapy or TSB is within 2 to 3 mg/dL of exchange transfusion level 
(see Chapter 15 for discussion of IVIG).

• Use total bilirubin. Do not subtract direct reacting or conjugated bilirubin.
• Risk factors: Isoimmune hemolytic disease, G6PD deficiency, asphyxia, significant lethargy,
 temperature instability, sepsis, acidosis, or albumin <3.0 g/dL (if measured)
• For well infants 35–37 6/7 wk, can adjust TSB levels for intervention around the medium risk line.
 It is an option to intervene at lower TSB levels for infants closer to 35 wk and at higher TSB
 levels for those closer to 37 6/7 wk.
• It is an option to provide conventional phototherapy in hospital or at home at TSB levels
 2–3 mg/dL (35–50 mmol/L) below those shown, but home phototherapy should not be used in
 any infant with risk factors.

c.	 Neonatal double-­volume exchange transfusion (see Table 18.9 and 
Fig. 18.6):
	
(1)	 Volume: 160 mL/kg for full-­term infant, 160 to 200 mL/kg for 
preterm infant.
	
(2)	 Route: During exchange, blood is removed through umbilical 
arterial catheter (UAC) and an equal volume is infused through 
UVC. If UAC is unavailable, use a single venous catheter.
	
(3)	 Procedure: Replaces up to 85% of infant’s circulation. Exchange 
in 15-­mL aliquots for full-­term infants. Exchange at 2 to 3 mL/kg/
min in premature/less stable infants to avoid hemolysis.
	
(4)	 Complications: Emboli, thromboses, hemodynamic instability, 
electrolyte disturbances, coagulopathy, infection, death.
NOTE: CBC, reticulocyte count, peripheral smear, bilirubin, Ca2+, glucose, 
total protein, infant blood type, Coombs test, and newborn screen should 
be performed on a preexchange sample of blood; they are of no diagnostic 
value with postexchange blood. If indicated, save preexchange blood for 
serologic or genetic studies. 
B.  Conjugated Hyperbilirubinemia (See Chapter 12)
	1.	 Definition: Direct bilirubin >2.0 mg/dL and >10% of TSB.

• The dashed lines for the first 24 hours indicate uncertainty due to a wide range of clinical
 circumstances and a range of responses to phototherapy.
• Immediate exchange transfusion is recommended if infant shows signs of acute bilirubin
 encephalopathy (hypertonia, arching, retrocollis, opisthotonos, fever, high-pitched cry)
 or if TBS is ≥5 mg/dL (85 µmol/L) above these lines.
• Risk factors: Isoimmune hemolytic disease, G6PD deficiency, asphyxia, significant lethargy,
 temperature instability, sepsis, acidosis.
• Measure serum albumin and calculate B/A ratio.
• Use total bilirubin. Do not subtract direct reacting or conjugated bilirubin.
• If infant is well and 35–37 6/7 wk (median risk), can individualize TSB levels for exchange
 based on actual gestational age.

	2.	 Etiology: Biliary obstruction/atresia, choledochal cyst, hyperalimentation, 
α1-­antitrypsin deficiency, hepatitis, sepsis, infections (especially urinary 
tract infections), hypothyroidism, inborn errors of metabolism, cystic 
fibrosis, red blood cell abnormalities.
	3.	 Management: Ursodiol for infants on full feeds; consider supplementa-
tion with fat-­soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K); otherwise depends on etiol-
ogy. Phototherapy is not contraindicated but poses the risk for “bronze 
baby” syndrome. 
C.  Polycythemia
	1.	 Definition: Venous hematocrit >65% confirmed on two consecutive 
samples. May be falsely elevated when obtained by heel stick or falsely 
lower when obtained by arterial stick.
	2.	 Etiologies: Delayed cord clamping, twin-­twin transfusion, maternal-­fetal 
transfusion, intrauterine hypoxia, Beckwith-­Wiedemann syndrome, 
maternal diabetes, neonatal thyrotoxicosis, congenital adrenal hyperpla-
sia, trisomies.
	3.	 Clinical findings: Plethora, respiratory distress, cardiac failure, tachy-
pnea, hypoglycemia, irritability, lethargy, seizures, apnea, jitteriness, 
poor feeding, thrombocytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia.
	4.	 Complications: Hyperviscosity predisposes to venous thrombosis and 
CNS injury. Hypoglycemia may result from increased erythrocyte utiliza-
tion of glucose.
	5.	 Management: Partial exchange transfusion for symptomatic infants, 
with isovolemic replacement of blood with isotonic fluid. Blood is 
exchanged in 10-­ to 20-­mL increments to reduce hematocrit to <55%.
Estimated blood volume = birth weight (kg) × 90 mL/kg 
X.  GASTROINTESTINAL DISEASES
A.  Necrotizing Enterocolitis
	1.	 Definition: Serious intestinal inflammation and injury thought to be sec-
ondary to bowel ischemia, immaturity, and infection. Occurs principally 
in infants who have been fed.
	2.	 Risk factors: Prematurity, asphyxia, African American race, hypotension, 
polycythemia–hyperviscosity syndrome, umbilical vessel catheteriza-
tion, exchange transfusion, bacterial and viral pathogens, enteral feeds, 
PDA, congestive heart failure, cyanotic heart disease, RDS, intrauterine 
cocaine exposure.
	3.	 Clinical findings: See Table EC 18.B.
	
a.	 Systemic: Temperature instability, apnea, bradycardia, metabolic 
acidosis, hypotension, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.
	
b.	 Intestinal: Blood in stool, absent bowel sounds, and/or abdominal 
tenderness or mass. Elevated pregavage residuals in the absence of 
other clinical symptoms rarely raise a suspicion of NEC.
	
c.	 Radiologic: Ileus, intestinal pneumatosis, portal vein gas, ascites, 
pneumoperitoneum (see Chapter 26).

464    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	4.	 Management: Nothing by mouth, NG tube decompression, maintain 
adequate hydration and perfusion, broad spectrum antibiotics for 7 to 
10 days based on hospital antibiogram, surgical consultation. Surgery is 
performed for signs of perforation or necrotic bowel.
	5.	 Minimizing risk of NEC:
	
a.	 Several studies link the use of probiotics and a decreased risk of 
NEC.24 However, variations among formulations of probiotics, dos-
ing, and lack of long-­term studies on outcome have prevented the 
standard use of probiotics in the NICU.25
	
b.	 There have been additional studies on supplements including 
L-­arginine and lactoferrin.26-­28 Data remains insufficient to support a 
practice recommendation.29
	
c.	 The exclusive use of human milk, including donor breast milk, has 
been shown to decrease the risk of NEC and associated mortality.30 
B.  Bilious Emesis
See Table EC 18.C and Chapter 12. 
	1.	 Mechanical: Annular pancreas, intestinal atresia/duplication/malrotation/
obstruction (including adjacent organomegaly), meconium plug or ileus, 
Hirschsprung disease, imperforate anus.
	2.	 Functional (i.e., poor motility): NEC, electrolyte abnormalities, sepsis.
NOTE: Must eliminate malrotation as an etiology because volvulus is a surgi-
cal emergency.
C.  Abdominal Wall Defects (Table EC 18.D)
D. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (See Chapter 12) 
XI.  NEUROLOGIC DISEASES
A.  Neonatal Hypoxic-­Ischemic Encephalopathy:
	1.	 Initial Management31
	2.	 Hypothermia protocol: Infants with evidence of HIE shortly after birth 
who are >36 weeks gestation should be considered for hypothermia. 
Protocol should be initiated within 6 hours of delivery.
	3.	 Criteria for hypothermia vary by center but typically include one or more 
of the following:
	
a.	 Cord gas or blood gas in the first hour of life with a pH of <7.0 or 
base deficit of >16. For infants with a pH of 7.01 to 7.15 or base 
deficit of 10 to 15.9, additional criteria should be met (e.g., signifi-
cant perinatal event).
	
b.	 10-­minute APGAR ≤5.
	
c.	 Evidence of moderate to severe encephalopathy.
	
d.	 Need for assisted ventilation at birth for at least 10 minutes.
	4.	 Severity and outcome of HIE in full-­term neonate: Table 18.10. 
B.  Intraventricular Hemorrhage
	1.	 Definition: IVH usually arises in the germinal matrix and periventricular 
regions of the brain.

	2.	 Incidence:
	
a.	 30% to 40% of infants <1500 g; 50% to 60% of infants <1000 g
	
b.	 Highest incidence within first 72 hours of life: 60% within 24 hours, 
85% within 72 hours, and <5% after 1 week of age
	3.	 Diagnosis and classification:
	
a.	 Ultrasonography; grade is based on maximum amount of hemor-
rhage seen by age 2 weeks:
	
(1)	 Grade I: Hemorrhage in germinal matrix only
	
(2)	 Grade II: IVH without ventricular dilation
	
(3)	 Grade III: IVH with ventricular dilation
	
(4)	 Grade IV: Periventricular hemorrhagic infarct with or without IVH.
NOTE: Many institutions use descriptive data (as opposed to the grading 
system) to denote severity of IVH.
	4.	 Screening: Indicated in infants <32 weeks gestational age within 72 
hours of life; repeat in 1 to 2 weeks.
	5.	 Outcome: Infants with grade III and intraparenchymal hemorrhages have 
an increased risk for neurodevelopmental disabilities and posthemor-
rhagic hydrocephalus.

466    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
C.  Periventricular White Matter Injury
	1.	 Definition and ultrasound findings: Ischemic necrosis of periventricular 
white matter, characterized by CNS depression within first week of life 
and later findings of cysts on ultrasound with or without ventricular 
enlargement (caused by cerebral atrophy) or noncystic white matter 
injury visualized by MRI.
	2.	 Incidence: More common in preterm infants but also occurs in term infants.
	3.	 Etiology: Primarily ischemia-­reperfusion injury, hypoxia, acidosis, hypo-
glycemia, acute hypotension, low cerebral blood flow.
	4.	 Outcome: Commonly associated with cerebral palsy with or without 
sensory and cognitive deficits. 
D.  Neonatal Seizures (See Chapter 20)
E.  Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome
	1.	 Onset of symptoms usually occurs within first 24 to 72 hours of life (metha-
done may delay symptoms until 96 hours or later). Symptoms may last 
weeks to months. Box 18.1 shows signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal.
	2.	 Increasing evidence supports benefit of nonpharmacologic manage-
ment,32 including rooming in, breastfeeding, skin-­to-­skin, swaddling, 
and environmental controls such as decreased disruptions. 
F.  Peripheral Nerve Injuries
	1.	 Etiology: Result from lateral traction on shoulder (vertex deliveries) or 
head (breech deliveries).
	2.	 Clinical features (Table 18.11).
	3.	 Management: Evaluate for associated trauma (clavicular and humeral 
fractures, shoulder dislocation, facial nerve injury, cord injuries). Full 
recovery is seen in 85% to 95% of cases in first year of life. 
XII.  UROLOGIC DISORDERS
A.  Lower Urinary Tract Obstruction
	1.	 Definition: Rare birth defect caused by partial or complete blockage of 
the urethra. Common causes include posterior urethral valves (PUV), 
urethral atresia, and triad syndrome (constricted narrowing in mid-­
portion of urethra). More common in males.

Clinical Features
Erb-­Duchenne palsy 
(90% of cases)
C5–C6
Occasionally involves C4
Adduction and internal rotation of arm. Forearm 
is pronated; wrist is flexed. Diaphragm 
paralysis may occur if C4 is involved.
Total palsy  
(8%–9% of cases)
C5–T1
Occasionally involves C4
Upper arm, lower arm, and hand involved. 
Horner syndrome (ptosis, anhidrosis, and 
miosis) exists if T1 is involved.
Klumpke paralysis 
(<2% of cases)
C7–T1
Hand flaccid with little control. Horner 
syndrome if T1 is involved.

	2.	 Diagnosis and Evaluation: Fetal anatomy ultrasound (18 to 24 weeks) with 
visualization of markedly distended bladder, often with a thickened wall 
(greater than 2 mm).33 A “keyhole” sign representing dilation of the posterior 
urethral valve proximal to the obstruction may be seen, but is not specific.
	
a.	 Other tests include comprehensive anatomic survey or fetal MRI, 
echocardiogram, and karyotype to rule out co-­existing abnormalities 
and determine gender. More than 10% of cases are associated with 
Trisomy 13, 18, or 21.
	
b.	 Vesicocentesis can evaluate renal function by serially assessing urine 
electrolytes at 24 to 48 hour intervals.
	3.	 Clinical findings: Ureterectasis, caliectasis, hydronephrosis, pulmonary 
hypoplasia, renal dysplasia, oligohydramnios, clubfeet, Potter facies.
	4.	 Management: Fetal vesicoamniotic shunting or cystoscopy. Consultation 
with pediatric urology and nephrology to review postnatal course includ-
ing dialysis, vesicostomy, and transplantation. Elective termination or 
expectant management should be offered for fetuses with poor prognos-
tic profiles (Table EC 18.E). 
B.  Bladder Exstrophy-­Epispadias-­Cloacal Exstrophy Complex
	1.	 Definition: Anomalies involving urinary tract eversion; with genitourinary, 
musculoskeletal, and occasionally gastrointestinal malformations. See 
Table EC 18.F for comparison.
	2.	 Diagnosis: Fetal anatomy ultrasound showing abnormality of bladder 
filling, low-­set umbilical cord, abdominal mass that increases in size 
throughout pregnancy, separation of pubic bones and small genitals.
	3.	 Management: Reconstructive surgery that aims to establish bladder 
continence, preserve renal function, repair epispadias and genitalia, 
and close the pelvic bones. 
XIII.  RETINOPATHY OF PREMATURITY34
A.  Definition
Interruption of normal progression of retinal vascularization. 
B.  Etiology
Exposure of the immature retina to high oxygen concentrations can result 
in vasoconstriction and obliteration of the retinal capillary network, followed 
by vasoproliferation. Risk is correlated to degree of prematurity. 
C.  Diagnosis
Dilated funduscopic examination should be performed in the following 
patients:
	1.	 All infants born ≤30 weeks gestation
	2.	 Infants born >30 weeks gestation with unstable clinical course, includ-
ing those requiring cardiorespiratory support
	3.	 Any infant with a birth weight ≤1500 g 
D.  Timing35
	1.	 All infants born ≤27 weeks gestation, initial retinopathy of prematurity 
(ROP) screening examination performed at 31 weeks postmenstrual age.

	2.	 All infants born ≥28 weeks gestation, initial ROP screening examination 
performed at 4 weeks chronologic age.
	3.	 Infants born before 25 weeks gestation, consider earlier screening at 6 
weeks chronologic age (even if before 31 weeks postmenstrual age) based 
on the severity of comorbidities to enable earlier detection and treatment of 
aggressive posterior ROP (a severe form of rapidly progressive ROP).

I. PRENATAL ASSESSMENT OF FETAL HEALTH
A.  Fetal Anomaly Screening
	1.	 Fetal screening:
	
a.	 Chorionic villus sampling (CVS): Segment of placenta obtained either 
at 8 to 11 weeks gestation. Detects chromosomal abnormalities and 
metabolic disorders; however, it cannot detect neural tube defects or 
measure α-­fetoprotein (AFP). Complications include pregnancy loss 
(0.7% to 2%), maternal infection, increased risk for feto-­maternal 
hemorrhage, and fetal limb and jaw malformations.
	
b.	 Amniocentesis: 20 to 30 mL of amniotic fluid is withdrawn under 
ultrasound guidance after 16 to 18 weeks gestation. Detects chromo-
somal abnormalities, metabolic disorders, and neural tube defects. 
Complications include pregnancy loss (0.06% to 1.0%), leakage 
of amniotic fluid (1.7%), chorioamnionitis, vertical transmission to 
infant in mothers with chronic viral infections, and fetal scarring or 
dimpling of the skin.
	
c.	 Cell free DNA is a noninvasive prenatal screening test available for 
common trisomies and fetal sex determination. However, there are 
still limitations to this testing and further diagnostic testing is typically 
recommended for positive results.1
	2.	 Anatomy ultrasound: Performed at 18 to 20 weeks gestation.
	3.	 Maternal AFP: (Box EC 18.B) 
B.  Fetal Health
	1.	 Amniotic fluid volume estimation and amniotic fluid index (AFI): (Box EC 
18.C). AFI is calculated using ultrasound by adding together width of 
amniotic fluid pockets in four quadrants
	2.	 Biophysical profile test: (Table EC 18.H)
	3.	 Intrapartum Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) Monitoring:
	
a.	 Normal baseline FHR: 120 to 160 beats/min (bpm). Mild bradycardia 
is 100 to 120 bpm. Severe bradycardia is <90 bpm.
	
b.	 Normal beat-­to-­beat variability: Deviation from baseline of >6 bpm. 
Absence of variability is <2 bpm from baseline and is a sign of poten-
tial fetal distress, particularly when combined with variable or late 
decelerations.
	
c.	 Accelerations: Associated with fetal movements, are benign, and 
indicate fetal well-­being.
	
d.	 Decelerations:
	
(1)	 Early decelerations: Begin with onset of contractions. Heart rate 
reaches nadir at peak of contraction and returns to baseline as con-
traction ends. Early decelerations occur secondary to changes in vagal 
tone after brief hypoxic episodes or head compression and are benign.
	
(2)	 Variable decelerations: Represent umbilical cord compression 
and have no uniform temporal relationship to the onset of a 
contraction. Variable decelerations are considered severe when

heart rate drops to <60 bpm for about 60 seconds, with a slow

(3)	 Late decelerations: Occur after peak of contraction, persist after con-
traction stops, and show a slow return to baseline. Late decelerations 
result from uteroplacental insufficiency and indicate fetal distress. 
C.  Estimation of Gestational Age
	1.	 Last menstrual period (LMP). Naegele rule gives most accurate determi-
nation of gestational age
	
Estimation due date = (LMP −  3 months) + 7 days

I.  URINALYSIS1: TABLE 19.1
	A.	 Common indications include: Infectious workup (urinary tract infection 
[UTI], pyelonephritis), abdominal trauma, suspected diabetes or renal 
disease, rhabdomyolysis, edema, failure to thrive.
	B.	 Best if urine specimen is evaluated within 1 hour of voiding, otherwise 
should be kept at 4°C.
	C.	 Annual screening UAs are not recommended by the American 
Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) unless patient is at high risk of chronic 
kidney disease. 
II.  KIDNEY FUNCTION TESTS
A.  Tests of Glomerular Function
	1.	 Glomerulogenesis is complete at 36 weeks gestation. Glomerular 
filtration rate (GFR) increases over the first two years of life related to 
glomerular maturation.
	2.	 Normal GFR values, as measured by inulin clearance (gold standard), 
are shown in Table 19.2.
	3.	 Creatinine clearance (CCr): 
Closely approximates inulin clearance in the normal range of GFR. 
When GFR is low, CCr overestimates GFR. May be inaccurate 
in children with obstructive uropathy or problems with bladder 
emptying secondary to challenges getting complete timed urine 
collections.
	
CCr (mL / min / 1.73 m2) = [U× (V / P)] × 1.73 / BSA,	
where U (mg/dL) = urinary creatinine concentration; V (mL/min)= total 
urine volume (mL) divided by the duration of the collection (min) (24 
hours = 1440 minutes); P (mg/dL) = serum creatinine concentration 
(may average two levels); and BSA (m2) = body surface area.
	4.	 Estimated GFR (eGFR) from plasma creatinine: Varies related to body size/
muscle mass. If body habitus is markedly abnormal or a precise mea-
surement of GFR is needed, consider other methods. Creatinine must 
be in steady state to estimate GFR; use caution in the setting of acute 
kidney injury. Three methods to calculate estimated GFR:

a.	 Bedside Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) cohort: Only applicable 
if creatinine measured by enzymatic assay. Recommended for eGFR 
determination in children aged 1 to 16 years. Estimated GFRs of ≥75 mL/
min/1.73 m2 determined by this equation likely represent normal kidney 
function; clinical correlation is recommended with GFR estimation.2
eGFR(mL / min / 1.73 m2) = 0.413× (L / Pcr),
where 0.413 is the proportionality constant, L = height (cm), and Pcr 
= plasma creatinine (mg/dL).
	
b.	 Schwartz equation: Historical equation for eGFR in children. However, 
laboratories are increasingly shifting to enzymatic assays to determine 
creatinine; use of enzymatically determined creatinine (vs Jaffe method) 
with the Schwartz equation leads to overestimation of GFR and should 
be considered when applying clinically:
eGFR(mL / min / 1.73 m2) = kL / Pcr,
where k = proportionality constant (Table 19.3); L = height (cm); and 
Pcr = plasma creatinine (mg/dL).
	
c.	 Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and Chronic Kidney Disease 
Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-­EPI): Used to calculate GFR in those 
>18 years old. Available at NKDEP website (see Section XII).
	5.	 Other measurements of GFR: May be used when more precise deter-
mination of GFR is needed (e.g., dosing of chemotherapy). These 
methods include iothalamate, DTPA, and iohexol. Cystatin C is a low 
molecular protein that can also be used to estimate GFR and is more 
accurate than serum creatinine in individuals with conditions that 
significantly impact muscle mass, the source of creatinine. 
B.  Tests of Kidney Tubular Function
	1.	 Proximal tubule and solute handling:
	
a.	 Proximal tubule reabsorption: Proximal tubule is responsible for reab-
sorption of electrolytes, glucose, and amino acids. Studies to evaluate

476    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
proximal tubular function compare urine and blood levels of specific 
compounds, arriving at a percentage of tubular reabsorption (Tx):
	
	
Tx = 1−[(Ux / Px)/(UCr / PCr)]×100 %,	
where Ux = concentration of compound in urine; Px = concentration of 
compound in plasma; Ucr = concentration of creatinine in urine; and 
Pcr = concentration of creatinine in plasma. This formula can be used 
for amino acids, electrolytes, calcium, and phosphorus. It is commonly 
used to calculate tubular reabsorption of phosphate (TRP). In a patient 
with hypophosphatemia and preserved proximal tubular function, the 
tubular reabsorption of phosphate would be expected to be near 100%.
	
b.	 Fractional excretion of sodium (FENa)3: Commonly used to assess 
tubular function. Must consider sodium and volume status. May be 
inaccurate with recent diuretic use.
FENa = [(UNa / PNa) / (UCr / PCr)] × 100 %,
where UNa = concentration of sodium in urine; and PNa = concen-
tration of sodium in plasma. FENa is usually <1% in prerenal azote-
mia or glomerulonephritis, and >1% (usually >3%) in acute tubular 
necrosis (ATN) or postrenal azotemia. Infants have diminished ability 
to reabsorb sodium; FENa in volume-­depleted infants is <3%.
	
c.	 Fractional excretion of urea (FEurea): May be useful in certain clinical 
scenarios, including patients on diuretics. Use FENa equation above, 
substituting urea for sodium. FEurea is usually <35% in prerenal 
azotemia and >50% in ATN.3
	
d.	 Fractional excretion of bicarbonate (FHCO3): May help differentiate 
the types of renal tubular acidosis (RTA). The majority of bicarb 
reabsorption occurs in proximal tubule.
	
FeHCO3 = [(UHCO3 / PHCO3) / (UCr / PCr)] × 100 %,	
Normal FEHCO3 is <5%. Distal RTA is usually <5%. >15% suggests 
proximal (Type II) RTA.
	2.	 Distal tubule and pH balance:
	
a.	 Urine anion gap (UAG): Used as an indirect measure of ammonium 
production in the distal nephron.
UAG = UNa + UK −UCl,
where UNa = concentration of sodium in urine; UK = concentration 
of potassium in urine; and UCl = concentration of chloride in urine. 
Positive UAG (usually >20) suggests a distal RTA. Negative UAG (usu-
ally <−20) suggests high urinary NH4+ (e.g., secondary to diarrhea).
	
b.	 Urine pH: A urine acidification defect (distal RTA) should be sus-
pected when random urine pH values are >6 in the presence of 
moderate systemic metabolic acidosis. Confirm acidification defects 
by simultaneous venous or arterial pH, plasma bicarbonate concen-
tration, and determination of the pH of fresh urine.
	
c.	 Urine osmolality: Urine is concentrated distally in the kidney tubules. 
Urine osmolality, ideally on a first morning urine specimen, may be 
 

--- Page 623 ---
Chapter 19  Nephrology    477
19
used to evaluate capacity to concentrate urine. If osmolality is >600 
mOsm/L, then tubular dysfunction, including disease states such as 
diabetes insipidus leading to inappropriate water loss, is unlikely. For 
more formal testing, see the water deprivation test in Chapter 10.
	
d.	 Urine calcium: Hypercalciuria may be seen with distal RTA, vitamin D 
intoxication, hyperparathyroidism, immobilization, excessive calcium 
intake, use of steroids or loop diuretics, or an idiopathic cause. 
Diagnosis is as follows:
	
(1).	 24-­hour urine: Calcium >4 mg/kg/24 hr (gold standard)
	
(2).	 Spot urine: Determine calcium/creatinine (Ca/Cr) ratio. Normal 
urine Ca/Cr ratio does not rule out hypercalciuria. Correlate clini-
cally and follow elevated spot urine Ca/Cr ratio with a 24-­hr urine 
calcium determination if indicated (Table 19.4).4 
III.  CHRONIC HYPERTENSION5-­7
Note: See Chapter 1 for the management of acute hypertension and 
Chapter 7 for normal blood pressure (BP) parameters.
A.  Definition
Hypertension is defined as the sustained elevation of BP at or above the 
95th percentile for those <13 years or ≥130/80 for those ≥13 years. Any 
BP that is >90th percentile or ≥120/80 should be repeated at a clinic 
visit; if persistently elevated when confirmed by manual auscultation, 
the child should return for a repeat measurement for confirmation (see 
Section III.E). 
B.  Measurement of Blood Pressure in Children
	1.	 All children ≥3 years should have BP measured annually. Children 
≥3 years should have BP measured at all visits if at increased risk for 
hypertension: obesity, taking medications known to increase BP, renal 
disease, history of aortic arch obstruction/coarctation, diabetes.
	2.	 Children aged <3 years with risk factors should have BP measured 
at all well-­child care visits. Risk factors include history of prematurity 
<32 weeks gestation or small for gestational age, very low birth weight, 
congenital heart disease, kidney/urologic disease or family history of

kidney disease, recurrent UTIs, malignancy, solid organ or bone marrow 
transplant, taking medications known to increase BP, systemic illness 
associated with hypertension, and evidence of increased intracranial 
pressure.
	3.	 BP should be measured in a seated position in an upper extremity 
after 5 minutes of rest with feet/back/arm supported and mid-­cuff at 
heart level; auscultation is preferred. Appropriate cuff size has a blad-
der width at least 40% of upper arm circumference at midway point. 
Bladder length should cover 80% to 100% of arm circumference. Cuffs 
that are too small may result in falsely elevated BPs. Choose a larger-­
sized cuff if there is a choice between two. 
C.  Etiologies of Hypertension in Neonates, Infants, and Children 
(Table 19.5)
Drugs causing hypertension include glucocorticoids, calcineurin inhibitors, 
sympathomimetics, oral contraceptives, stimulants (methylphenidate), 
ephedrine, erythropoietin, NSAIDs, caffeine, tobacco, ethanol, cocaine, 
amphetamines. 
D.  Evaluation of Chronic Hypertension
	1.	 Rule out factitious causes of hypertension (improper cuff size or 
measurement technique [e.g., manual vs. oscillometric]), non-
pathologic causes of hypertension (e.g., fever, pain, anxiety, muscle 
spasm), and iatrogenic mechanisms (e.g., medications, excessive fluid 
administration).

	2.	 History: Headache, blurred vision, dyspnea on exertion, edema, 
obstructive sleep apnea symptoms (including poor sleep quality or 
duration), endocrine symptoms (diaphoresis, flushing, constipa-
tion, weakness, etc.), history of neonatal intensive care unit stay, rule 
out pregnancy, history of UTIs, history of medications and supple-
ments, illicit drug use, or any family history of kidney dysfunction or 
hypertension.
	3.	 Physical examination: Four-­extremity pulses and BPs, endocrine disease 
stigmata, edema, hypertrophied tonsils, skin lesions, abdominal mass, 
or abdominal bruit.
	4.	 Clinical evaluation of confirmed hypertension:
	
a.	 Laboratory studies:
	
(1)	 All patients: Urinalysis (UA), serum electrolytes, creatinine, blood 
urea nitrogen (BUN), lipid profile
	
(2)	 Obese patients: Hgb A1c, AST/ALT, fasting lipid panel
	
(3)	 Consider on basis of history and exam: Fasting serum glucose, 
thyroid stimulating hormone, drug screen, polysomnography, 
complete blood count
	
b.	 Clinical practice guidelines recommend 24-­hour ambulatory blood 
pressure monitoring (ABPM) be conducted in all children with 
persistently elevated blood pressure to confirm the diagnosis of 
hypertension. Other at-­risk populations (e.g., coarctation of the aorta 
status–post repair, CKD, history of hypertension) should also have 
this monitoring done yearly regardless of clinic blood pressure.
	
c.	 Imaging:
	
(1)	 Renal ultrasound in patients <6 years old or those with abnormal 
UA or renal function.
	
(2)	 Echocardiography to evaluate for left ventricular hypertrophy if 
pharmacologic treatment considered.
	
(3)	 Consider renovascular imaging if renal artery stenosis is 
suspected.
	
d.	 Patients ≥6 years of age do not require extensive evaluation for 
secondary causes if they have a strong family history of hypertension 
(HTN), are overweight, and do not have any evidence of secondary 
causes on history and physical exam. 
E.  Classification and Treatment of Hypertension (Table 19.6)
Target: SBP and DBP to <90th percentile and <130/80 mmHg in adoles-
cents ≥13 years old. Consider target 50th percentile in those with CKD.
	1.	 Nonpharmacologic: Aerobic exercise, sodium restriction, smoking 
cessation, and weight loss indicated in all patients with hypertension. 
Reevaluate BP after lifestyle interventions, and begin pharmacologic 
therapy if hypertension persists.
	2.	 Pharmacologic: Indications include secondary hypertension, symptom-
atic hypertension, stage 2 hypertension without a clearly modifiable fac-
tor (e.g., obesity), diabetes mellitus, and persistent hypertension despite 
nonpharmacologic measures.

	3.	 Treatment monitoring: Repeat echocardiogram every 6 to 12 months in 
those with cardiac end organ damage or those at high risk. Repeated 
24-­hour ABPM can be used to assess treatment effectiveness as 
needed.

F.  Antihypertensive Drugs for Outpatient Management of Primary 
Hypertension in Children 1 to 17 Years of Age
Clinical guidelines recommend angiotensin-­converting-­enzyme inhibitors, 
angiotensin II receptor blockers, thiazide diuretics, or long-­acting calcium 
channel blockers as first-­line medications for management of chronic 
hypertension in children.6 Medication choice may be impacted by underly-
ing comorbidities, contraindications, and side effects. Providers should 
familiarize themselves with existing guidelines, medication contraindica-
tions, and side effects. A list of medications and common side effects is 
found in Table 19.7.

C.  Risk Factors
2011 AAP guidelines,8 reaffirmed in 2016,9 for children 2 to 24 months 
provide resources to help clinicians stratify the risk of UTI in the absence of 
another source of infection in a febrile child.
	1.	 Females are at higher risk for UTI than males.
	2.	 Uncircumcised males are at higher risk than circumcised males.
	3.	 Other risk factors include non-­black race, fever ≥39°C, and fever >1 to 2 days. 
D.  Methods of Urine Collection
	1.	 If a child is 2 months to 2 years old, has a fever, and appears sufficiently 
ill to warrant immediate antibiotics, obtain UA and urine culture by 
transurethral catheterization. Suprapubic percutaneous aspiration may 
be useful in critically ill children, is generally very safe, and is similar to 
bladder catheterization in sensitivity and specificity.
	2.	 If a child is 2 months to 2 years old, has a fever, and does not appear ill enough 
to warrant immediate antibiotics, obtain urine by catheterization or the most 
convenient method available. Bag or absorbent pad may be helpful when UTI 
is unlikely (to rule out infection), but both have very high false positive rates 
(>75% of cultures positive) and should not be sent for culture.8 If UA does not 
suggest UTI, it is reasonable to avoid antimicrobial therapy. If UA does suggest 
UTI, urine culture should be obtained by catheterization.
	3.	 If a child is >2 years old and toilet trained, may provide midstream 
clean-­catch urine specimen. 
E.  Diagnosis
To establish the diagnosis of UTI, both UA results suggestive of infection 
and positive urine culture are recommended.
	1.	 Nitrite test:
	
a.	 Detects products of reduction of dietary nitrates by urinary gram-­
negative bacterial species (especially Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and 
Proteus).
	
b.	 Sensitivity 15% to 82% and specificity 90% to 100% for UTI.8
	
c.	 Special circumstances: False-­negative (low sensitivity) results 
commonly occur with insufficient time (<4 hours) for conversion of 
urinary nitrates to nitrites (age-­dependent voiding frequency) and 
inability of bacteria to reduce nitrates to nitrites (many gram-­positive 
organisms such as Enterococcus, Mycobacterium spp., and fungi).
	2.	 Leukocyte esterase test:
	
a.	 Detects esterase released from leukocyte lysis.
	
b.	 Sensitivity 67% to 84% and specificity 64% to 92% for UTI.8
	3.	 Pyuria is defined at a threshold of ≥5 WBCs/hpf. Absence of pyuria is 
rare if a true UTI is present.
	4.	 Urine culture:
	
a.	 Transurethral catheterization or suprapubic aspiration: >50,000 
colony-­forming units (CFU) per mL diagnostic of UTI. Some sources 
suggest >10,000 CFU/mL in the presence of fever, symptoms, and 
pyuria may also be diagnostic.10
 

--- Page 630 ---
484    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	
b.	 Clean catch: >100,000 CFU/mL necessary to diagnose a UTI.
	
c.	 Bagged specimen: Should not be used to collect urine culture.
	
d.	 Catheter-­associated (indwelling urethral or suprapubic): No specific 
data for pediatric patients. Adult Infectious Diseases Society of 
America guidelines define it as presence of symptoms and signs 
compatible with UTI and >1000 CFU/mL of one or more bacterial 
species in a single catheter urine specimen or in a midstream voided 
urine specimen from a patient whose catheter has been removed 
within previous 48 hours.11 
F.  Classification
Pyelonephritis (upper UTI), rather than cystitis (lower UTI), is suggested 
by fever ≥38.5°C (especially if lasting >48 hours after initiating appropriate 
antibiotics), systemic symptoms, costovertebral angle tenderness, elevated 
CRP, leukocytosis. 
G.  Imaging
	1.	 Renal and bladder ultrasound (RBUS): Evaluates for anatomic abnormalities 
and abscesses. Indications include children 2 to 24 months with first UTI, 
recurrent or atypical UTIs, or if no response to treatment within 48 hours. If 
there is clinical improvement <48 hours and follow up is reliable, should be 
done after full recovery. If there is no response to treatment or follow up is 
uncertain, then RBUS during illness is indicated.
	2.	 Voiding cystourethrography (VCUG): Evaluates bladder anatomy, empty-
ing, and looks for signs of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Should not be 
obtained routinely after first febrile UTI. Indications include children 2 
to 24 months with abnormal RBUS findings (hydronephrosis, scarring, 
or other findings suggestive of either high-­grade VUR or obstructive 
uropathy), complicated or recurrent pyelonephritis.8 Consider if family 
history of VUR. Optimal time is 2 to 6 weeks after infection. 
H.  Treatment of Culture-­Positive Urinary Tract Infection
For empiric therapy, see Chapter 17.
	1.	 Organisms:
	
a.	 E. coli is the most common cause of pediatric UTI.
	
b.	 Other common pathogens: Klebsiella, Proteus spp., Staphylococcus 
saprophyticus, and Staphylococcus aureus.
	
c.	 Neonatal UTI: Group B streptococci and other bloodborne 
pathogens.
	
d.	 Enterococcus and Pseudomonas are more prevalent in abnormal 
hosts (e.g., recurrent UTI, abnormal anatomy, neurogenic bladder, 
hospitalized patients, or those with frequent bladder catheteriza-
tions). Consider blood cultures if urine grows uncommon organism or 
Staphylococcus.
	2.	 Treatment considerations and duration:
	
a.	 Route: Parenteral antibiotics for children who are toxic, dehy-
drated, or unable to tolerate oral medication due to vomiting or 
noncompliance.
 

--- Page 631 ---
Chapter 19  Nephrology    485
19
	
b.	 Duration: 3 to 5 days for uncomplicated cases12; 7 to 14 days for 
toxic children and those with pyelonephritis.
	3.	 Inadequate response to therapy: Consider renal abscess or urinary 
obstruction; RBUS and repeat urine culture is indicated. Repeat cul-
tures should also be considered in patients with recurrent UTIs to rule 
out persistent bacteriuria.
	4.	 Management of VUR:
	
a.	 Classification of VUR: Fig. 19.1
	
b.	 Antibiotic prophylaxis: Evidence suggests that prophylactic 
trimethoprim-­sulfamethoxazole reduces the risk of UTI recurrence 
by 50%, but with no significant difference in renal scarring. Some 
experts suggest that recent studies are insufficiently powered 
to detect a difference in the relatively rare outcomes of renal

scarring, and thus recommend shifting guideline recommenda-
tions from “no prophylaxis” to “selective prophylaxis” in certain 
groups of patients.13
	
c.	 Surgical intervention: Monitor persistence/grade of VUR annually, often 
in consultation with a pediatric urologist. Spontaneous resolution may 
occur, although less likely with higher grade. Higher-­grade VUR that 
persists as the child grows may ultimately require surgical intervention.
	5.	 Asymptomatic bacteriuria: Defined as bacteria in urine on microscopy 
and Gram stain in an afebrile, asymptomatic patient without pyuria. 
Antibiotics not necessary if voiding habits and urinary tract are normal.
	6.	 Referral to pediatric urology: Consider in children with abnormal voiding 
patterns based on history or imaging, neurogenic bladder, abnormal 
anatomy, recurrent UTI, or poor response to appropriate antibiotics. 
V.  PROTEINURIA14–16
A.  Definitions
	1.	 Orthostatic proteinuria: Excretion of significant amounts of protein while 
in the upright position. A benign condition and common cause of pro-
teinuria in children and adolescents.
	2.	 Fixed proteinuria: Proteinuria found on first morning urine void over 
several consecutive days. Suggestive of kidney disease.
	3.	 Microalbuminuria: Presence of albumin in urine below detectable range 
of dipsticks. In adults, defined as 30 to 300 mg/g creatinine. Most often 
used in screening for kidney disease secondary to diabetes.
	4.	 Significant proteinuria: Urine protein to urine creatinine (UPr:UCr) ratio 
0.2 to 2.0 mg/mg or 4 to 40 mg/m2/hr in a 24-­hour collection.
	5.	 Nephrotic-­range proteinuria: UPr:UCr ratio >2 mg/mg or >40 mg/m2/
hr in a 24-­hour collection. In adults, 24-­hour urine protein excretion of 
3000 mg/24 hours.
	6.	 Nephrotic syndrome: Nephrotic-­range proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, 
edema, and hyperlipidemia (cholesterol >200 mg/dL). 
B.  Methods of Detection
	1.	 Urinalysis (see Table 19.1): Proteinuria on a urine dipstick should be 
verified by a urine protein/creatinine ratio in an appropriately collected 
first morning urine specimen. Urine samples collected immediately 
upon rising in the morning help distinguish the contribution of benign 
orthostatic proteinuria to the proteinuria detected on dipstick or ran-
domly timed spot urine collection.
	2.	 First morning urine protein/creatinine ratio:
	
a.	 Approximates 24-­hour urine collections well.
	
b.	 Appropriate collection is essential for accurate results. A child must 
empty the bladder before going to bed. If the child gets up during 
the night, the bladder should be emptied before returning to bed. 
When the child wakes up in the morning, the urine sample should be 
provided immediately.
 

--- Page 633 ---
Chapter 19  Nephrology    487
19
	
c.	 Normal ratios:
	
(1)	 <2 years old: <0.5 mg/mg
	
(2)	 >2 years old: <0.2 mg/mg
	
d.	 Abnormal ratios (mg/mg): Significant proteinuria detected on a first 
morning protein/creatinine ratio should prompt verification of appropri-
ate collection. Repeat specimen should be analyzed within 1 to 2 
weeks, or sooner based on clinical scenario (e.g., edema, hyperten-
sion, or symptom of concern would prompt a more expedited workup).
	3.	 24-­hour urine protein: May have a contribution from benign orthostatic 
proteinuria, which cannot be ruled out without a fractional urine collec-
tion. Protein level >4 mg/m2/hr is considered significant. 
C.  Etiologies (Box 19.1)
See Section VI.E for discussion of nephrotic syndrome. 
D.  Evaluation15
Further evaluation is necessary if proteinuria is significant/symptomatic and 
not secondary to orthostatic proteinuria (Box 19.2). 
E.  Nephrotic Syndrome16
	1.	 Epidemiology: Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome of childhood is the most 
common form, representing approximately 90% of cases in children 
between the ages of 1 and 10 years. Minimal change disease is the 
most common renal pathology found among children with idiopathic 
nephrotic syndrome in this age group. Nephrotic syndrome may be a 
manifestation of a primary kidney disease, a systemic disorder resulting 
in glomerular injury, or rarely medication.
	2.	 Clinical manifestations: Hypoalbuminemia and decrease in oncotic pres-
sure results in generalized edema. Initial swelling commonly occurs on the 
face (especially periorbital), as well as in the pretibial area. Eye swelling is 
often mistaken for allergic reactions or seasonal allergies (Box 19.3).
BOX 19.1
CAUSES OF PROTEINURIA
Transient proteinuria: Caused by fever, exercise, dehydration, cold exposure, 
seizure, stress
Orthostatic proteinuria
Glomerular diseases with isolated proteinuria: Idiopathic (minimal change disease) 
nephrotic syndrome, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, mesangial proliferative 
glomerulonephritis, membranous nephropathy, membranoproliferative glomerulo-
nephritis, amyloidosis, diabetic nephropathy, sickle cell nephropathy
Glomerular diseases with proteinuria as a prominent feature: Acute postinfectious 
glomerulonephritis, immunoglobulin A nephropathy
Tubular disease: Cystinosis, Wilson disease, acute tubular necrosis, tubuloint-
erstitial nephritis, polycystic kidney disease, renal dysplasia, toxic tubular injury 
(medications, heavy metals)

	3.	 Etiologies: See Table 19.8.
	4.	 Investigations at first presentation: UA and microscopy (microhematuria 
present in 30% and is not prognostic); urine P/Cr ratio; serum albumin, 
total protein, cholesterol, creatinine; infectious workup (consider tuber-
culosis, HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, as indicated).
	5.	 Management of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome of childhood: Empirical 
corticosteroid treatment without kidney biopsy is recommended for 
children without atypical features. Hospitalization recommended for 
children with overwhelming edema or infection.

a.	 Steroid-­responsive: Approximately 95% of patients with minimal 
change disease (MCD) and 20% with focal segmental glomeruloscle-
rosis (FSGS) achieve remission within 4 to 8 weeks of starting pred-
nisone. Response to corticosteroids is the best prognostic indicator, 
including the likelihood of underlying MCD.
	
(1)	 Although duration of therapy varies, one common regimen 
includes prednisone 60 mg/m2 daily or 2 mg/kg/day (maximum 
dose 60 mg/day) for 6 weeks, followed by 40 mg/m2 or 1.5 mg/kg 
on alternate days for 6 weeks.16
	
(2)	 Relapses of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome are treated with a 
shorter duration of corticosteroids, which also vary according to 
the center and the consensus body. Commonly, prednisone 60 
mg/m2 or 2 mg/kg/day (maximum dose 60 mg/day) until urine 
protein is negative for 3 consecutive days, followed by 40 mg/m2 
or 1.5 mg/kg on alternate days for 4 weeks.
	
b.	 Frequently relapsing: Defined as 2 or more relapses within 6 months 
of initial response, or 4 or more relapses in any 12-­month period.
	
c.	 Steroid-­dependent: Defined as 2 consecutive relapses during taper-
ing or within 14 days of cessation of steroids. Some patients can be 
managed with low-­dose steroids, given daily or on alternate days, but 
many will relapse. Second-­line treatments for frequently relapsing and 
steroid-­dependent nephrotic syndrome: Cyclophosphamide, mycophe-
nolate mofetil (MMF), calcineurin inhibitors, levamisole, or rituximab.
	
d.	 Steroid-­resistant: Lack of remission or partial remission after 8 weeks 
of corticosteroids. Second-­line agents, including calcineurin inhibitors 
or MMF, are often introduced once steroid resistance is confirmed.
	
e.	 Indications for renal biopsy: Macroscopic hematuria, age <12 
months or >12 years, systemic or syndromic findings, persistent 
creatinine elevation >1 to 2 weeks, low complement levels, and per-
sistent proteinuria after 4 to 8 weeks of adequate steroid treatment.17
	6.	 Complications:
	
a.	 AKI; thromboembolic disease; potentially life-­threatening infection. 
See Chapter 16 for vaccine recommendations.
	
b.	 Chronic systemic steroids: Cushingoid skin changes, cataracts, 
accelerated atherosclerosis, osteoporosis, gastric ulcer, mood swings, 
insomnia, insulin resistance, immunosuppression. 
VI.  HEMATURIA18
A.  Definition
	1.	 Microscopic hematuria: >5 RBCs/hpf on centrifuged urine. Not visible to 
the naked eye.
	2.	 Macroscopic (gross) hematuria: Visible blood in urine.
	3.	 Acute nephritic syndrome: Classically tea or cola-­colored urine, facial or 
body edema, hypertension, and oliguria.

Differentiate glomerular and extraglomerular hematuria: Examine urine sedi-
ment, looking for RBC casts and protein.
	1.	 Glomerular hematuria
	
a.	 Usually hypertensive; dysuria usually absent; edema, fever, pharyngi-
tis, rash, and arthralgia may suggest glomerular disease.
	
b.	 Laboratory: Dysmorphic RBCs and casts on UA, complete blood 
cell count (CBC) with differential and smear, serum electrolytes with 
calcium, BUN/creatinine, serum protein/albumin, and other testing 
driven by history and exam, including ANA, hepatitis B and C serolo-
gies, HIV, audiology screen, if indicated.
	
c.	 Consider other studies to determine underlying diagnosis: C3/C4, 
antineutrophil antibody (c-­ and p-­antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibod-
ies), anti–double-­stranded DNA
	2.	 Extraglomerular hematuria
	
a.	 Rule out infection: Urine culture, gonorrhea, chlamydia
	
b.	 Rule out trauma: History, consider imaging of abdomen/pelvis
	
c.	 Investigate other potential causes: Urine Ca/Cr ratio or 24-­hour 
urine for kidney stone risk analysis, sickle cell screen, renal/bladder 
ultrasound. Consider serum electrolytes with calcium, coagulation 
studies.

VII.  ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY19,20
A.  Definition
Sudden decline in kidney function; clinically represented by rising creati-
nine, with or without changes in urine output. 
B.  Etiology (Table 19.10)
Causes are generally subdivided into three categories:
	1.	 Prerenal: Impaired perfusion of kidneys, the most common cause of 
acute kidney injury (AKI) in children. Volume depletion is a common 
cause of prerenal AKI.
	2.	 Renal:
	
a.	 Parenchymal disease due to vascular or glomerular lesions.
	
b.	 Acute tubular necrosis: Diagnosis of exclusion when no evidence of 
renal parenchymal disease is present and prerenal and postrenal 
causes have been eliminated, if possible.
	3.	 Postrenal: Obstruction of the urinary tract, commonly due to inherited 
anatomic abnormalities in children. 
C.  Clinical Presentation
Pallor, decreased urine output, systemic and pulmonary edema, hypertension, 
vomiting, and lethargy. The hallmark of early kidney failure is often oliguria.
	1.	 Oliguria: Urine output <0.5 mL/kg/hr (for at least 6 hours). May reflect 
intrinsic or obstructive kidney disease. Always interpret urine output in 
the context of physical exam, clinical scenario, and fluid delivery.

For example, low urine output may be appropriate (physiologic 
response to water depletion in a prerenal state) and “normal” urine 
output may be inappropriate in a volume-­depleted patient (potentially

D.  Acute Tubular Necrosis
Clinically defined by three phases:
	1.	 Oliguric phase: Period of severe oliguria that may last days. If oliguria or 
anuria persists for longer than 3 to 6 weeks, kidney recovery from ATN 
is less likely.
	2.	 High urine output phase: Begins with increased urine output and 
progresses to passage of large volumes of isosthenuric urine containing 
sodium levels of 80 to 150 mEq/L.
	3.	 Recovery phase: Signs and symptoms usually resolve rapidly, but poly-
uria may persist for days to weeks. 
E.  Treatment Considerations
	1.	 Careful monitoring of volume status (daily weights, strict input/
output). Consider placement of indwelling catheter to monitor urine 
output.
	2.	 Prerenal and postrenal factors should be addressed or excluded.
	3.	 Intravascular volume resuscitation and maintenance with appropriate 
fluids in consultation with a pediatric nephrologist.
	4.	 Monitor metabolic/electrolyte abnormalities, discontinue unnecessary 
nephrotoxic medications and follow drug levels closely when avail-
able, adjust dosing of medications based on creatinine clearance (see 
Chapter 31), monitor blood pressure closely, and maintain appropriate 
nutrition (low phosphorus, low potassium).
	5.	 See Section IX for indications for acute dialysis 
F.  Complications
	1.	 Dependent on clinical severity.
	2.	 Usually includes fluid overload (hypertension, congestive heart failure 
[CHF], or pulmonary edema), electrolyte disturbances (hyperkalemia), 
metabolic acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, and uremia. 
G.  Radiographic Imaging Considerations in AKI/CKD
	1.	 To prevent radiographic contrast-­induced nephropathy, select radio-
graphic studies that do not require administration of a radiographic 
iodinated contrast media (RICM) if possible, particularly in high-­risk 
populations, such as patients with AKI or CKD.21
	2.	 If RICM is required, use of low or iso-­osmolality contrast media is 
preferred.21
	3.	 Hydration has been found to be effective in preventing or minimizing 
contrast-­induced nephropathy in some studies of high-­risk populations. 
Intravenous hydration 6 hours prior to and 6 to 12 hours after contrast 
administration has been studied.21
	4.	 Use of N-­acetylcysteine is controversial in preventing contrast-­induced 
nephropathy.21
	5.	 Gadolinium and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis: The triad of gadolinium 
use, a pro-­inflammatory state, and renal impairment (GFR <30 mL/min 
per 1.73 m2, peritoneal or hemodialysis) is associated with nephrogenic 
 

--- Page 642 ---
496    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
systemic fibrosis. Gadolinium is contraindicated in patients with GFR 
<30 mL/min per 1.73 m2, and caution should be used at GFR levels 
between 30 and 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2.22 
VIII.  CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE23
A.  Definition
Kidney damage for >3 months, as defined by structural or functional 
abnormalities, with or without decreased GFR. Classified as:
Stage I: Kidney injury with normal or increased GFR
Stage II: GFR 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2
Stage III: GFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2
Stage IV: GFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2
Stage V: GFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m2 or dialysis 
B.  Etiology
	1.	 Children <5 years: Most commonly due to congenital abnormalities 
(e.g., kidney hypoplasia/dysplasia, urologic malformations).
	2.	 Older children: More commonly acquired glomerular diseases (e.g., glo-
merulonephritis, FSGS) or hereditary disorders (e.g., Alport syndrome).
C. Clinical Manifestations (Table 19.12) 
D.  General Management
	1.	 Nutrition: Growth should be monitored closely; supplemental nutrition 
should be considered if not reaching caloric goals, which are higher in 
children with CKD. Potassium and sodium restriction may be required 
in advanced CKD. Growth hormone therapy may be considered in 
consultation with pediatric nephrology/endocrinology.
	2.	 Anemia: Evaluate with CBC and iron studies. Iron deficiency is com-
mon and should be treated with oral (preferred) or IV iron. Consider 
erythropoietin-­stimulating agents in consultation with pediatric 
nephrology.
	3.	 CKD–mineral and bone disorder: Characterized by phosphate retention, 
decreased free calcium, and decreased 1,25 hydroxyvitamin D. Serum 
calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, vitamin D, and parathyroid 
hormone should be regularly monitored. Control phosphate with phos-
phate binders, supplement with calcium and vitamin D, as indicated.
	4.	 Cardiovascular: Regularly monitor blood pressure and lipid panel. 
Treating hypertension slows the progression of CKD. 
IX.  DIALYSIS
A.  Indications for Acute Dialysis
When metabolic or fluid derangements are not controlled by aggressive 
medical management alone. Should be initiated in consultation with a 
nephrologist. Generally accepted criteria include the following:
	1.	 Acidosis: Intractable metabolic acidosis.

498    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	2.	 Electrolyte abnormalities: Hyperkalemia >6.5 mEq/L despite restriction 
of delivery and medical management; calcium and phosphorus imbal-
ance (e.g., hypocalcemia with tetany, seizures in the presence of a very 
high serum phosphate level); derangements implicated in neurologic 
abnormalities.
	3.	 Ingestion or accumulation of dialyzable toxins or poisons: Lithium, 
ammonia, alcohol, barbiturates, ethylene glycol, isopropanol, methanol, 
salicylates, theophylline. Consult poison control experts when available.
	4.	 Volume overload: Evidence of pulmonary edema or hypertension.
	5.	 Uremia: BUN >150 mg/dL (lower if rising rapidly), uremic pericardial 
effusion, neurologic symptoms. 
B.  Techniques
	1.	 Peritoneal dialysis (PD): Requires catheter to access peritoneal cav-
ity, as well as adequate peritoneal perfusion. May be used acutely or 
chronically. Contraindications: Abdominal wall defects (omphalocele, 
gastroschisis, bladder exstrophy, diaphragmatic hernia), severe inflam-
matory bowel disease, or infectious source in the abdomen.24
	2.	 Intermittent hemodialysis (HD): Requires placement of special vascular 
access catheters. May be method of choice for certain toxins (e.g., 
ammonia, uric acid, poisons) or when there are contraindications to 
peritoneal dialysis.
	3.	 Continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration/hemodialysis (CAVH/D) and 
continuous venovenous hemofiltration/hemodialysis (CVVH/D): Requires 
special vascular access catheter. Lower efficiency of solute removal com-
pared with intermittent hemodialysis, but higher efficiency is not neces-
sary because of the continuous nature of this form of dialysis. Sustained 
nature of dialysis allows for more gradual removal of volume/solutes, 
which is ideal for patients with hemodynamic or respiratory instability. 
C.  Complications
	1.	 PD catheter leaks: Confirm leakage of PD fluid with glucose dipstick. 
Discontinue PD for 7 to 10 days or lower dialysate volume.
	2.	 PD associated peritonitis (PDAP): Acute clouding of dialysate, abdominal 
pain/distention, vomiting. Culture peritoneal fluid and start empiric intra-
peritoneal antibiotics in consultation with nephrology. Refer to published 
Consensus Guidelines for treatment recommendations.25
	3.	 Intradialytic hypotension in HD: Causes include rapid fluid removal, 
pre-­dialysis antihypertensive medication, bradykinin release, hypotonic 
dialysate. Reduce or pause ultrafiltration. 
X.  TUBULAR DISORDERS
A.  Renal Tubular Acidosis (Table 19.13)26
	1.	 A group of transport defects resulting in abnormal urine acidification; 
due to defects in reabsorption of bicarbonate (HCO3−), excretion of 
hydrogen ions (H+), or both.
 

--- Page 645 ---
Chapter 19  Nephrology    499
19
	2.	 Results in a persistent normal anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic 
acidosis.
	3.	 RTA syndromes have a normal GFR and often do not progress to kidney 
failure.
	4.	 Clinical presentation may be characterized by failure to thrive, polyuria, 
constipation, vomiting, and dehydration.
	5.	 Fractional excretion of bicarbonate (FeHCO3) should be checked after a 
HCO3 load. Can help differentiate the types of RTA. See Section II.B for 
equation.
	6.	 Urine anion gap (UAG) is also useful; however, it should not be used 
when a patient is volume depleted or has an anion-­gap metabolic acido-
sis. See Section II.B for equation.

500    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
B.  Fanconi Syndrome
	1.	 Generalized dysfunction of the proximal tubule resulting not only in 
bicarbonate loss but also in variable wasting of phosphate, glucose, and 
amino acids.
	2.	 May be hereditary, as in cystinosis and galactosemia, or acquired 
through toxin injury and other immunologic factors.
	3.	 Clinically characterized by rickets and impaired growth. 
C.  Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus
	1.	 Water conservation is dependent on antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and its 
effects on the distal renal tubules. Polyuria (urine output >5 mL/kg/hr 
or >2 L/day), a hallmark of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), is 
due to diminished or lack of response of the ADH receptor in the distal 
renal tubules. Hereditary defects of ADH receptor or acquired insults 
(e.g., interstitial nephritis, sickle cell disease, lithium toxicity, CKD) may 
underlie NDI.
	2.	 Must be differentiated from other causes of polyuria: Central diabetes 
insipidus (ADH deficiency that may be idiopathic or acquired through 
infection or pituitary trauma; see Chapter 10), diabetes mellitus, psy-
chogenic polydipsia, cerebral salt wasting. 
XI.  NEPHROLITHIASIS27-­30
A.  Risk Factors
Male sex; history of UTI (especially those <5 years); congenital and struc-
tural urologic abnormalities (urinary stasis), neurogenic bladder, hypercal-
ciuria, hyperoxaluria/oxalosis, hypocitraturia, other metabolic abnormalities; 
family history of stones, renal failure, consanguinity. 
B.  Presentation
	1.	 Microscopic hematuria (90%), flank/abdominal pain (50% to 75%), 
gross hematuria (30% to 55%), and concomitant UTI in up to 20%.
	2.	 Have higher likelihood than adults of having asymptomatic stones, 
especially younger children. 
C.  Diagnostic Imaging
	1.	 Ultrasonography is an effective and preferred modality, particularly 
at centers with expertise, given benefit of avoiding radiation exposure 
(75% sensitive for renal stones).29
	2.	 Noncontrast CT may be preferred to improve diagnostic sensitivity (e.g., 
with radiolucent stones such as uric acid stones, ureteral stones, lack of 
ultrasonographic expertise). 
D.  Management
	1.	 Pain control, urine culture, hydration. Some centers initiate α-­blockers 
to facilitate stone passage, although evidence of benefit in children is 
equivocal.30-­32
 

--- Page 647 ---
Chapter 19  Nephrology    501
19
	2.	 Antibiotics: Should be considered in treatment of all stones, especially if 
fever and/or pyuria present, because of the high association with UTI.
	3.	 Urologic intervention (e.g., extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, ure-
teroscopy, percutaneous nephrolithotomy): Consider with unremitting 
pain, urinary obstruction, increasing stone size, size ≥7 mm, or cystine/
struvite stone, especially in the setting of AKI or at-­risk patients (e.g., 
solitary kidney, anatomic anomalies).32
	4.	 Strain urine to collect stone; analyze stone composition to aid in preven-
tion of future stones. 
E.  Workup
	1.	 Up to 75% of children with a kidney stone will have a metabolic abnor-
mality (e.g., hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, hyperuricosuria, cystinuria).
	2.	 Workup should include analysis of the stone (if possible); UA; basic 
metabolic panel; and serum calcium, phosphate, magnesium, and uric 
acid levels. If evidence of elevated calcium or phosphate, obtain para-
thyroid hormone (PTH) level and consider checking 25-­ and 1,25(OH) 
vitamin D levels.
	3.	 After symptoms have resolved, a 24-­hour urine collection should be 
obtained. Risk factors for stone formation should be analyzed: urine 
volume, osmolarity, sodium, calcium, urate, oxalate, citrate, and cystine. 
This test is also referred to as a “stone risk analysis.” 
F.  Prevention
	1.	 All children with history of stones should increase fluid intake (e.g., at 
least 2 L/day in those aged >10 years old).
	2.	 Targeted interventions of any identified metabolic abnormalities 
(e.g., low-­sodium diet in those with hypercalciuria). Pharmacologic 
interventions are also available in certain scenarios (e.g., citrate 
supplementation).
	3.	 Dietary Modifications: Long–term adherence (5 years) to normal cal-
cium, low–sodium diet may decrease recurrence of stones in people 
with idiopathic hypercalciuria with recurrent nephrolithiasis.33

STRENGTH RATING SCALE
0/5: No movement (i.e., no palpable tension at tendon)
1/5: Flicker of movement
2/5: Movement in a gravity-­neutral plane
3/5: Movement against gravity but not resistance
4/5: Subnormal strength against resistance (requires accommodation to execute 
movement)
5/5: Normal strength against resistance (motion is smooth, comfortably executed, 
without any accommodations)
	2.	 Focus initial investigation along three axes for meaningful lesion localization:
	
a.	 Distal deficit with preserved (or less impaired) proximal sensation 
suggests polyneuropathy.
	
(1)	 Pain/temperature deficit: small fiber polyneuropathy/anterior 
spinal cord.
	
(2)	 Position/vibration deficit: large fiber polyneuropathy/posterior 
spinal cord.
	
b.	 Lower body more affected than upper body suggests spinal cord 
injuries.
	
(1)	 See Fig. 20.1 for dermatomes.
	
(2)	 Ask about continence.
	
c.	 If difference between left and right, concern for unilateral brain or 
spinal cord lesion. 
E.  Reflexes
	1.	 Tendon Reflexes: Gradation (Box 20.2) and localization (Table EC 20.B). 
Helpful in localizing abnormalities including upper versus lower motor 
neuron pathology, especially in presence of weakness or asymmetry 
(Table EC 20.C). Compare right to left, upper to lower extremities, and 
distal to proximal reflexes. Generalized high or low reflexes of little 
significance in setting of normal strength and coordination.
	2.	 Primitive reflexes: Expected during specific time windows (Table 20.1). 
F.  Coordination and Gait
	1.	 Evaluate coordination while watching age-­appropriate activities.
	2.	 Tests for cerebellar function: Rapid alternating movements, finger-­to-­
nose, heel-­to-­shin, walking, running. 
II.  HEADACHES1–11
A.  Classification of Headaches
	1.	 Primary headaches: Migraines, tension-­type, cluster, trigeminal auto-
nomic cephalgias (TACs), other primary headache disorders.
	2.	 Secondary headaches: Trauma, infection, substance use or withdrawal, vas-
cular disorder, neurologic disorder, increased intracranial pressure (ICP).
	3.	 Differential diagnosis: Acute (Box 20.3) and chronic (Box 20.4)

504    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
B.  Evaluation of Headaches
Obtain history (Box 20.5) and physical exam (Table EC 20.D); evaluate 
for red flags (Box 20.6). If red flags present, obtain appropriate imaging 
(computed tomography [CT] for hemorrhage, magnetic resonance imaging/
angiography (MRI/MRA) for vascular abnormalities). Perform lumbar punc-
ture (LP) if concern for subarachnoid hemorrhage (not detected on CT), 
infection, or increased ICP (Box 20.7). If no red flags present and normal 
neurologic exam, imaging and LP not recommended.

subdural hemorrhage
	4.	 Vascular: Vasculitis, arteriovenous malformation, hypertension, cerebrovascu-
lar accident
	5.	 Bone, soft tissue: Referred pain from scalp, eyes, ears, sinuses, nose, teeth, 
pharynx, cervical spine, temporomandibular joint
	6.	 Infection: Systemic, encephalitis, sinusitis

BOX 20.5
IMPORTANT HISTORICAL INFORMATION IN EVALUATING HEADACHE
	1.	 When did the headaches begin?
	2.	 How did the headache begin? Associated trauma, social stressors (school, 
home)?
	3.	 What is the frequency and duration of the headaches?
	
a.	 Headache pattern (intermittent, progressive, chronic, etc.)
	
b.	 Time of day
	4.	 Where is the pain, what is it like, and does it radiate? Focal occipital pain is 
concerning for secondary headaches.
	5.	 Associated symptoms? What do you do during the headache?
	
a.	 Aura or prodrome
	
b.	 Constitutional symptoms (weight changes), vision changes, or any other 
neurologic symptoms (weakness, tingling, photophobia, phonophobia)
	
c.	 Triggers and alleviating/exacerbating factor
	6.	 Other history (e.g., health problems, medications, family history of migraine)
	7.	 How do the headaches affect your ability to function? Ask about school 
absences.
C.  Migraine Headache
	1.	 Migraines can be throbbing, pulsatile, or pressure-­like in children. 
Usually bifrontal in children and unilateral in adolescents and adults. 
There are many potential triggers (e.g., stress, caffeine, menses, sleep 
disruption). See Box 20.8 for diagnostic criteria.
	2.	 Classification1: With versus without aura. An aura is any neurologic 
symptom that occurs prior to onset of a migraine (e.g., visual aberra-
tions, paresthesias, numbness, dysphasia).
	3.	 Precursors to migraines and close associations: Cyclic vomiting, abdomi-
nal migraines, paroxysmal vertigo of childhood, paroxysmal torticollis of 
infancy, and motion sickness.
	4.	 Treatment: Combination of acute and prophylactic treatment.
	
a.	 Acute symptomatic: Avoid medication overuse (no more than 2 to 3 
days/week); can lead to rebound headaches. Optimal acute therapy 
can prevent progression to chronic migraines.
	
b.	 Outpatient setting:
	
(1)	 Dark, quiet room and sleep.
	
(2)	 Acetaminophen and/or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) (e.g., naproxen, ibuprofen, ketorolac).
	
(3)	 Caffeine (e.g., coffee, tea, soda).
	
(4)	 Triptans: Not typically used in emergency room or inpatient 
setting (only effective at migraine onset). Limit use to twice per 
week.

(5)	 Antidopaminergics have antiemetic properties, though effective 
even if nausea is not a predominant factor. Prochlorperazine 
shown to be superior to metoclopramide.48 Sometimes more 
effective than NSAIDs in emergency department setting.
	
c.	 Emergency department (ED)/inpatient setting:
	
(1)	 Often helpful to combine medications and administer intravenous 
(IV) “migraine cocktail” (see Fig. 20.2 for example ED algorithm).
	
(2)	 Steroids (e.g., methylprednisolone) may be useful in intractable 
cases, although evidence is lacking.

4.	 New onset focal neurological symptoms
	
5.	 Optic nerve edema
	
6.	 Nuchal rigidity
	
7.	 Seizures
	
8.	 Visual symptoms not typical of migraines (e.g., colorful, hallucinatory, short 
duration), diplopia, decreased visual acuity, visual field deficits
	
9.	 Concurrent fever (especially if accompanied by other red flags)
	 10.	 Headache worse with supine position or Valsalva (cough, straining)
	 11.	 Association with persistent emesis

ness, constipation, virilization)
BOX 20.7
LUMBAR PUNCTURE7,47
	1.	 See Chapter 4 for indications, contraindications, and procedure.
	2.	 Standard tests: Cell counts + differential, Gram stain, CSF culture, protein, 
glucose. Consider viral studies (e.g., herpes simplex virus, enterovirus, etc.).
	3.	 Manometer for OP if concern for increased intracranial pressure. Performed 
in a lateral decubitus position. OP of <28 cm H2O generally considered nor-
mal; however, interpret results in concert with other clinical and examination 
findings.
	4.	 There is inconsistent evidence regarding correction factors for CSF white 
blood cell counts in the setting of blood-­contaminated CSF from a traumatic 
lumbar puncture.
	5.	 Xanthochromia: Yellow or pink discoloration of CSF due to breakdown of 
hemoglobin. Suspect subarachnoid hemorrhage.
CSF, Cerebrospinal fluid; OP, opening pressure.

d.	 Preventative treatment:
	
(1)	 Lifestyle modification is mainstay. Adequate sleep,9 meals, hydra-
tion, regular exercise. Avoid triggers, stress, caffeine withdrawal.
	
(2)	 Alternative/complementary therapies:
	
(a)	 Cognitive-­behavioral therapy
	
(b)	 Biofeedback
	
(c)	 Physical therapy

(3)	 Consider prophylactic medications (Table EC 20.E) if migraines 
occurring more than once per week, affecting quality of life, 
frequent ED visits, complicated migraines, or migraines not 
responsive to abortive medications. Conflicting evidence 
regarding efficacy. Recent randomized controlled trial dem-
onstrated that preventative medication was no more effective 
than placebo. New biologic (calcitonin gene-­related peptide or 
CGRP)10,11 approved in adults in 2018; there are no published 
studies yet in pediatric population.

fever in a child 6 to 60 months of age that is nonfocal, lasts for <15 
minutes, and does not recur in a 24-­hour period.
	
(1)	 Management: Identify the source of fever. No further workup 
(neuroimaging or electroencephalogram [EEG]) or antiseizure 
drugs are necessary for a simple febrile seizure in a well-­
appearing fully immunized child with a normal neurologic exami-
nation and no meningeal signs.
	
(2)	 Indications for LP: Meningeal signs, incomplete or unknown 
Haemophilus influenzae or Streptococcus pneumoniae immu-
nization status, or if pretreated with antibiotics (which can mask 
signs and symptoms of meningitis).

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF RECURRENT EVENTS THAT MIMIC EPILEPSY IN 
CHILDHOOD20,50
Event
Differentiation from Epilepsy
SYNCOPE AND ANOXIC EVENTS
Breath-­holding spells (18 
months–3 years)
Loss of consciousness and generalized convulsions, always provoked 
by an event that makes child upset.
Vasovagal syncope
Triggers: Postural change, heat, emotion. Preceded by dizziness and 
vision loss. Slow collapse to floor, may have brief confusion after 
event.
Cardiogenic syncope
Triggers: Exercise, strong emotion. Abnormal ECG/Holter monitor find-
ing. No consistent convulsive movements.
Cough syncope
Prolonged cough spasm during sleep in asthmatic, leading to loss of 
consciousness, often with urinary incontinence.
BEHAVIORAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS
Psychogenic nonepileptic 
seizure (PNES)
Also known as pseudoseizures. No EEG changes except movement 
artifact during event. Thrashing, proximal truncal movements. Eye 
closure with resistance to opening. Guards face with hand drop. 
Brief/absent postictal period. Often exacerbated by psychological 
stressor.
SLEEP-­RELATED CONDITIONS
Narcolepsy
Excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy (sudden atonia triggered by 
emotion), sleep paralysis, sudden onset REM on EEG.
PAROXYSMAL MOVEMENT DISORDERS
Tics
Involuntary, nonrhythmic, repetitive movements not associated with 
impaired consciousness. Strong urge to perform movement but 
suppressible.
Stereotypies (mannerisms) Repetitive movements or vocalizations (e.g., rocking, head banging).
Paroxysmal dyskinesias
Dystonia, choreoathetosis in response to specific triggers (e.g., 
startle). Often familial.
MIGRAINE-­ASSOCIATED DISORDERS
Migraine
Headache or visual changes that may precede attack. Autonomic 
or sensory changes can mimic focal seizure. Family history of 
migraines. EEG with regional area of slowing during attack.
Paroxysmal vertigo 
(toddler)
Episode of vertigo, vomiting, staggering, and falling in a child. May 
become anxious, no loss of awareness.
MISCELLANEOUS EVENTS
Sandifer syndrome
GER in infancy. Paroxysmal dystonic posturing (back arching) associ-
ated with meals.
Myoclonus
Involuntary muscle jerking or twitch
ECG, Electrocardiography; EEG, electroencephalography; GER, gastroesophageal reflux; REM, rapid eye movement.

	4.	 Evaluation of unprovoked seizures
	
a.	 Rule out provocative factors: Obtain vitals. Consider checking 
glucose, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, complete blood 
cell count, toxicology screen.
	
b.	 EEG is recommended in all children with first unprovoked seizure to 
evaluate for an epilepsy syndrome, however it does not need to be 
emergently obtained.14 Interictal EEGs may be normal, particularly in 
children with focal seizures. Repeat EEGs, prolonged EEG monitoring 
with video as clinically indicated.
	
c.	 Imaging: High resolution MRI can assist with identification of under-
lying brain malformation, although is not routinely indicated when 
evaluating a first-­time seizure. CT scan is not recommended.
	5.	 Epilepsy: Recurrent, unprovoked seizures or diagnosis of genetic 
syndrome characterized by recurrent seizures. Assess seizure type, 
epilepsy classification (Table EC 20.F),15–17 and severity of disorder. See 
Table 20.3 for selected epilepsy syndromes of childhood.
	6.	 Breakthrough seizures: Assess for missed medications or significant 
weight gain, lack of sleep, stress, drugs/alcohol, physical exertion, ill-
ness, dehydration, flickering lights, menses, and drug interactions that 
can lower seizure threshold (tricyclic antidepressants, certain antibiotics, 
over-­the-­counter cold preparations, diphenhydramine, herbal supple-
ments). Obtain drug levels (see Table 20.4 for therapeutic drug levels).
	7.	 Status epilepticus22: Traditionally defined as continuous seizure activity 
lasting approximately > 5 minutes or two discrete seizures without 
return of consciousness between them. See Chapter 1 for management.
	8.	 Treatment19,20,23–25
	
a.	 First seizure, nonfocal, and with return to baseline: No antiseizure 
drug indicated. Overall recurrence approximately 50% in 2 to 5 
years. Epileptiform abnormalities on EEG indicate a higher chance of 
recurrence.
	
b.	 Educate parents and patient regarding seizure safety.20 Review 
seizure first aid, including supervision during bathing or swimming. 
Be aware of driver’s license laws in the state. Advocate teacher and 
school awareness.
	
c.	 Pharmacotherapy (see Table 20.4): Initiate if known etiology of sei-
zure (diagnosis of epilepsy syndrome), recurrent unprovoked seizure 
(risk of recurrent seizure >80% after second unprovoked seizure). 
Choose therapy according to seizure type. Consider rectal diazepam 
if seizures are prolonged or hemodynamic instability.
	
d.	 Ketogenic diet25:
	
(1)	 High-­fat, low-­carbohydrate therapy typically used for intractable 
seizures.
	
(2)	 Should be managed by trained providers.
	
(3)	 Urine/serum ketones can be monitored to assess compliance.
	
(4)	 Side effects include transient GI upset and hyperlipidemia, 
chronic metabolic acidosis, kidney stones, fractures.

516    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	
(5)	 Factor in carbohydrate content of formulations when prescribing 
medications to child on ketogenic diet.
	
(6)	 Avoid dextrose-­containing IV fluids.
	
e.	 Surgical therapies considered for children with identified seizure focus 
located in noneloquent cortex and/or failed antiseizure drug therapies.
	
(1)	 Device implantation: Vagus nerve stimulation, deep brain stimula-
tion, responsive neurostimulation (NeuroPace).
	
(2)	 Resections: Hemispherectomy, focal resection (e.g., temporal 
lobectomy), corpus callosotomy. 
IV.  HYDROCEPHALUS26–28
A.  Etiology
Communicating (due to abnormal cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] reabsorption) 
versus noncommunicating (due to obstruction of CSF flow) and congenital 
versus acquired (postinfectious, posthemorrhagic, due to mass lesions). 
B.  Diagnosis
	1.	 Clinical signs: apneas, bradycardias, macrocephaly, increasing head 
circumference (HC), bulging/tense fontanelle, splayed sutures, head-
aches, blurry/spotty vision, decreased level of consciousness, “setting-­
sun” eye sign due to upward gaze paresis, vomiting, Cushing triad 
(hypertension, bradycardia, irregular respirations), papilledema, CN 
palsies (III, IV, VI).
	2.	 In infants, obtain serial measurements of HC. Obtain neuroimaging if 
significant increase in HC percentile or if patient is symptomatic.
	3.	 Imaging: Ultrafast MRI preferred to CT where available (see Chapter 26). 
C.  Treatment
	1.	 Medical:
	
a.	 Emergently manage acute increase of ICP (see Chapter 1).
	
b.	 Slowly progressive hydrocephalus: Acetazolamide and furose-
mide may provide temporary relief by decreasing the rate of CSF 
production.
	2.	 Surgical: CSF shunting versus endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV).
	
a.	 Ventriculoperitoneal shunts used most commonly.
	
b.	 Patients with shunt dysfunction often present with signs of increased 
ICP. Causes include infection, obstruction (clogging or kinking), dis-
connection, migration of proximal or distal tips, valve programming.
	
c.	 Evaluation of shunt integrity: See Chapter 26 for discussion of imag-
ing. Consult pediatric neurosurgery (if available).

VI.  STROKE31–33
A.  Pediatric Stroke
50% ischemic, 50% hemorrhagic. Presents similarly to stroke mimics, 
but less common and frequently missed (Box 20.11). Neonatal stroke 
frequently presents with nonfocal symptoms: seizures, altered level of con-
sciousness, feeding difficulties. Important to consider stroke on differential 
of acute neurologic changes. 
BOX 20.9
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF ACUTE ATAXIA
	
1.	 Ingestion (e.g., antiseizure drugs, antipsychotics, sedatives, hypnotics) or 
intoxication (e.g., alcohol, hydrocarbon fumes, heavy metals)
	
2.	 Postinfectious: cerebellitis (e.g., viral causes), acute disseminated 
encephalomyelitis
	
3.	 Head trauma: cerebellar contusion or hemorrhage, posterior fossa hema-
toma, vertebrobasilar dissection, postconcussion syndrome
	
4.	 Basilar migraine
	
5.	 Benign paroxysmal vertigo
	
6.	 Intracranial mass lesion: tumor, vascular malformation
	
7.	 Opsoclonus–myoclonus ataxia syndrome: Chaotic eye movements 
combined with ataxia and myoclonus. Postinfectious or paraneoplastic 
(neuroblastoma/neural crest tumors) etiology.
	
8.	 Hydrocephalus
	
9.	 Infection: labyrinthitis, abscess
	 10.	 Seizure: ictal or postictal
	 11.	 Vascular events: cerebellar hemorrhage or stroke
	 12.	 Guillain-­Barré syndrome or Miller-­Fisher variant (ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, 
and areflexia). Warning: If bulbar signs present, patient may lose ability to 
protect airway.
	 13.	 Rare inherited paroxysmal ataxias
	 14.	 Inborn errors of metabolism
	 15.	 Multiple sclerosis
	 16.	 Somatic symptom disorder
BOX 20.10
CONSIDERATIONS FOR INITIAL EVALUATION OF ACUTE ATAXIA
	1.	 Complete blood cell count, electrolytes, and urine and serum toxicology
	2.	 Imaging (CT or MRI)
	3.	 Lumbar puncture
	4.	 EEG
	5.	 If neuroblastoma is suspected (opsoclonus–myoclonus ataxia syndrome), 
obtain urine vanillylmandelic acid and homovanillic acid, and CT of chest and 
abdomen.
CT, Computed tomography; EEG, electroencephalogram; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging.

B.  Etiologies Vary by Age (Table EC 20.G)31
Patients with increased risk of recurrent stroke: history of cardiac 
disease and cardiac surgery, cerebral arteriopathy, sickle cell disease, 
thrombophilias. 
C.  Management
	1.	 Stroke team activation (where available) or urgent neurology consulta-
tion, along with transfer to a tertiary care center with expertise in child-
hood stroke.
	2.	 Supportive care and neurologic monitoring. Maintain normoglycemia, 
maintain normothermia (avoid fevers). Monitor for signs of increased 
ICP.
	3.	 Optimize cerebral perfusion pressure: Ensure adequate fluid volume and 
maintenance of median blood pressure (BP) for age, allow permissive 
hypertension.
	4.	 Reperfusion therapies: Not routinely recommended in children due to 
lack of evidence, but an active area of research. Thrombolytic therapy 
with IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) or mechanical thrombectomy 
may be considered under appropriate circumstances in centers with 
extensive pediatric stroke experience (American Heart Association 
guidelines).
	5.	 Children with sickle cell disease: Consult a hematologist. Hydration and 
emergent exchange transfusion to reduce sickle hemoglobin to <30% 
(see Chapter 14).

	2.	 Clinical features: Varying degrees of symmetric and progressive, 
proximal more than distal, muscle weakness with preserved cognition. 
Patients with severe forms do not survive past early childhood without 
treatment due to respiratory failure.
	3.	 Treatment: Evaluation of weak/hypotonic infant for possible spinal 
muscular atrophy (SMA) is urgent, as effective treatment (nusinersen 
[Spinraza]) is possible, but magnitude of benefit decreases with 
time. 
BOX 20.12
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF ENCEPHALOPATHY
	
1.	 Infectious and parainfectious: meningitis, encephalitis, ADEM
	
2.	 Autoimmune: NMDAR, VGKC-­complex, Hashimoto thyroiditis–associated
	
3.	 Trauma
	
4.	 Seizure-­related: status epilepticus, postictal, epileptic encephalopathy
	
5.	 Toxins: medications, drugs, heavy metals, carbon monoxide
	
6.	 Metabolic: uremia, hyperammonemia, hyper-­ or hypoglycemia, lactic 
acidosis
	
7.	 Hypertension, PRES
	
8.	 Hypoxic-­ischemic: neonatal, drowning, cardiorespiratory arrest, vascular
	
9.	 Intracranial hemorrhage
	 10.	 Malignancy
	 11.	 Genetic: leukoencephalopathy, mitochondrial, ADANE
ADANE, Autosomal-­dominant acute necrotizing encephalitis; ADEM, acute disseminated encepha-
lomyelitis; NMDAR, N-­methyl-­D-­aspartate receptor; PRES, posterior reversible encephalopathy 
syndrome; VGKC, voltage-­gated potassium channel.

B.  Duchenne or Becker Muscular Dystrophy40
	1.	 Etiology: X-­linked mutation in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) 
gene, encoding dystrophin, causes disruption of muscular cytoskel-
eton. Mostly affects males. Duchenne form is more severe and caused 
by complete disruption of dystrophin; partial disruption causes milder 
Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD).
	2.	 Clinical features: Delayed motor milestones. Progressive proximal sym-
metric muscle weakness starting in early childhood leading to wheel-
chair use for mobility by age 13. Elevated serum CK levels.
	3.	 Treatment: Corticosteroids (prednisone or deflazacort [Emflaza]) are 
mainstays.41 Requires multidisciplinary management: At high risk for 
cardiomyopathy and respiratory and orthopedic complications. Novel 
disease-­modifying agent, eteplirsen (Exondys 51), limited to patients 
with specific DMD mutations. 
C.  Myasthenia Gravis42
	1.	 Etiology: Autoantibodies binding the acetylcholine receptor impair 
neuromuscular junction function. Subtypes include transient neonatal 
myasthenia (due to transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies from 
mother with myasthenia), congenital myasthenic syndrome (genetic 
defects of neuromuscular junction proteins), and juvenile (classic auto-
immune in children).
	2.	 Clinical features: A key feature is fatigable, variable weakness. Often 
concentrates in orbital muscles (double vision, ptosis, ophthalmopare-
sis), or bulbar weakness (slurred/nasal voice, difficulty chewing, swal-
lowing, talking). Can also manifest with generalized weakness of limbs 
and trunk. Triggers include illness, fever, heat, and some medications. 
Bulbar weakness can worsen with illness and compromised airway. A 
good bedside test of bulbar muscle fatigue is the “slurp test.”43 Ask 
patient to imbibe four ounces of water through a straw quickly—if con-
sumption slows after 1 or 2 ounces, at risk of bulbar decompensation; 
if marked slowing or times especially prolonged, at risk for respiratory 
failure.
	3.	 Treatment: Refer to/consult specialist for management.
	
a.	 Myasthenic crisis/rapid onset of symptoms: plasmapheresis, IVIG, 
and IV neostigmine. Evaluate the need to secure definitive airway.
	
b.	 Chronic management:
	
(1)	 Oral pyridostigmine
	
(2)	 Prednisone (caution about paradoxical worsening with any large 
initial dose)
	
(3)	 Immunosuppressive medications (e.g., mycophenolate, 
rituximab)
	
(4)	 Thymectomy may be helpful 
D.  Acute Guillain-­Barré Syndrome44,45
	1.	 Etiology: Presumed immune attack against peripheral nerve myelin. In 
some cases, triggered by illness, notably Campylobacter jejuni infection.
 

--- Page 675 ---
Chapter 20  Neurology    521
20
	2.	 Clinical features and diagnosis: Rapid decline with nadir less than two 
weeks after onset; respiratory status can be compromised. Back pain 
often prominent in children. Often with autonomic instability. Elevated 
spinal fluid protein without cellular infiltrate (“albumocytologic dissocia-
tion”). Nerve conduction studies can be helpful.
	3.	 Treatment: Patients should be hospitalized at presentation to monitor for 
respiratory stability. Acute phase treatment with IVIG, plasmapheresis 
helpful if initiated early. Supportive care.
	4.	 Variants of Guillain-­Barré syndrome (GBS)
	
a.	 Acute: Miller Fisher syndrome (ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and are-
flexia), acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN)
	
b.	 Chronic: Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) 
is a similar but slower progressive autoimmune disorder that often 
requires chronic immunosuppressive therapy. 
E.  Infantile Botulism46
	1.	 Etiology: Affects infants <1 year of age, most commonly <6 months, 
due to colonization of colon by Clostridium botulinum bacteria (infants 
are susceptible due to immaturity of gut flora). Botulinum toxin released 
into bloodstream, irreversibly cleaves protein complex necessary for 
acetylcholine vesicle release into neuromuscular junction.
	2.	 Clinical features and diagnosis: Subacute onset weakness of skeletal 
muscles diffusely, concentrating in eye, face, and bulbar muscles early. 
Weak pupil constriction responses common and specific when present. 
Presenting symptom often constipation for days to weeks before onset 
of weakness, poor feeding, and weak cry. At high risk for respiratory 
failure due to respiratory and bulbar muscle weakness. Tachycardia 
is common. Confirmation of diagnosis by toxin assay of stool (not 
culture) performed by state lab or CDC; may use minimal amount of 
sterile, nonbacteriostatic water colonic enema for specimen collec-
tion. Electromyography and nerve conduction studies can help confirm 
diagnosis.
	3.	 Treatment: Assess and stabilize airway: approximately 50% of infants 
require intubation/advanced airway. Treat with one-­time dose of human 
botulism immune globulin (BabyBIG or BIG-­IV), available through Infant 
Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program (http://www.infantbotulis
m.org/). Prompt treatment is key; do not wait for confirmatory testing. 
With appropriate treatment, prognosis for full recovery is excellent. See 
Chapter 16 for recommended interval before measles or varicella vac-
cination after botulism immune globulin administration.

Jaime La Charite, MD, MPH
I.  ASSESSMENT OF GROWTH
A.  Types of Growth Charts
	1.	 Child <24 months: World Health Organization (WHO) international 
growth charts1
	2.	 Child ≥2 years: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
growth charts2
	3.	 Growth charts for premature infants
	
a.	 Corrected age = infant’s chronologic age − number of weeks of pre-
maturity (using 40 weeks as full-­term gestation) and should be used 
up to 3 years.3,4
	
b.	 Chronologic age should be used if child’s growth “catches up” before 
3 years.5
	
c.	 Oslen, Bertino, and Fenton growth charts can be used to assess 
growth in premature infants up to 41 weeks (Oslen) to 50 weeks 
(Fenton).6 After 4 to 8 weeks post-­term, the WHO growth chart can 
be used.7
	
d.	 The choice of growth chart has some variability across practice sites 
and preferences.8
	4.	 Special populations9,10
	
a.	 WHO or CDC growth charts are recommended in all cases due to 
limited reference data for condition-­specific growth charts.
	
b.	 Condition-­specific growth charts can show families how a specific 
condition can alter growth potential.
	
c.	 Growth charts have been created for Down syndrome, Prader-­Willi 
syndrome, Williams syndrome, Cornelia de Lange syndrome, Turner 
syndrome, and Marfan syndrome. 
B.  Interpretation of Growth Charts11,12
	1.	 Stunting/short stature: Length or height <5th percentile
	2.	 Underweight:
	
a.	 Children <2 years: Weight for length/height <5th percentile
	
b.	 Children ≥2 years: Body mass index (BMI) for age <5th percentile or 
BMI <18.5 kg/m2
	3.	 Healthy weight: BMI for age 5th percentile to <85th percentile or BMI 
18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2
	4.	 Overweight:
	
a.	 Children <2 years: Weight for length/height >95th percentile
 

--- Page 681 ---
524    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	
b.	 Children ≥2 years: BMI for age ≥ 85th to <95th percentile or BMI 25 
to 29.9 kg/m2
	5.	 Obese:
	
a.	 Children <2 years: No consensus definition exists
	
b.	 Children ≥2 years: BMI for age ≥95th percentile or BMI ≥30 kg/m2 
C.  General Guidelines Regarding Appropriate Growth13,14
	1.	 Term infants usually lose approximately 5% to 10% of their birth weight, 
but regain the weight within 2 weeks.
	2.	 Infants should gain 20 to 30 g/day from birth to 3 months, 15 to 22 g/
day from 3 to 9 months, and 6 to 11 g/day from 9 to 12 months.
	3.	 Term infants double their birth weight in 4 to 5 months and triple it by 1 
year of age.
	4.	 Height doubles from birth to age 3 to 4 years of age.
	5.	 The average size of a 4-­year-­old is 40 in. and 35 lb.
	6.	 From age 3 to 10 years of age, children grow an average of 2.5 inches 
per year. 
II.  MANAGEMENT OF OVERWEIGHT AND OBESE CHILDREN
A.  AAP Recommendations for the Prevention of Obesity15-­17
	1.	 Exclusive breastfeeding until 6 months of age and then breastfeeding 
maintenance until at least 12 months.
	2.	 Daily breakfast and family meal times.
	3.	 Limit sugary beverages, fast food, energy-­dense foods, and encourage 
fruits and vegetables.
	4.	 Develop a family media plan with limits and technology-­free zones. 
For infants less than 18 months, no media other than video chatting. 
If media used with toddlers 18-24 months, parents should watch and 
engage with children during use. For children 2 to 5 years, a max of one 
hour of high-­quality programming a day with co-­viewing when possible.
	5.	 Recommend 60 minutes of moderate-­to-­vigorous exercise per day.

MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING STRATEGIES FOR CHILDREN BASED ON BODY MASS 
INDEX50-­52
BMI
Initial Management
Monitoring—Follow up
Normal BMI
 • 
Praise child and family
 • 
Screen for genetic dyslipidemia 
with nonfasting lipid profile 
between ages 9–11 and 18–21
 • 
Maintain weight velocity
Next well child visit
Normal BMI that is increasing 
percentiles (crossing two 
percentile lines is a risk 
factor for obesity)
 • 
Screen for genetic dyslipidemia as 
above
 • 
Patient education
Next well child visit
Overweight BMI
 • 
Patient education
 • 
If health risk factors, obtain fast-
ing glucose, hemoglobin A1c or 
oral glucose tolerance test, lipid 
profile, ALT, and AST
2–4 weeks
Obese BMI
 • 
Patient education
 • 
Obtain fasting glucose, hemoglo-
bin A1c or oral glucose tolerance 
test, lipid profile, ALT, and AST
 • 
Some specialist clinics screen for 
vitamin D deficiency and insulin 
resistance (i.e., measure fasting 
insulin), but their clinical utility 
and cost effectiveness is unclear
 • 
No guidelines on which age to start 
laboratory screening, but some 
experts start at 2 years of age
 • 
Consider other labs (e.g., thyroid 
studies, cortisol) based on clini-
cal picture
2–4 weeks
Further follow-­up and management for those who are overweight or obese:
 (a) At each follow-­up, record weight, measure blood pressure, and use an empathetic and empowering counseling style 
(e.g., motivational interviewing).
 (b) Establish goals: Positive behavior change, weight maintenance, or decrease in BMI velocity. Children aged 2 to 
5 years who have obesity should not lose more than 1 pound/month; older children and adolescents with obesity 
should not lose more than an average of 2 pounds/week.
 (c) 
If no improvement after 3 to 6 months, refer to structured weight management program. If no improvement after 3 
to 6 months, the next step is a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach. If no improvement, refer for evaluation 
at a tertiary care center for medication management and weight reduction surgery.
ALT, Alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; BMI, body mass index.

III.  MALNUTRITION IN INFANTS AND CHILDREN
A.  Defining Malnutrition16
NOTE: Also called growth failure or under-­nutrition; previously called failure 
to thrive.
	1.	 Condition of under-­nutrition generally identified in the first 3 years of life
	2.	 Can be described by the following growth scenarios:
	
a.	 Primary indicators when single data point available
	
(1)	 Weight for length/height z-­score
	
(2)	 BMI for age z-­score
	
(3)	 Length/height for age z-­score

D.  Differential Diagnosis of Malnutrition19
	1.	 Secondary to disease/injury
	2.	 Decreased intake (e.g., fluid restriction, cardiac failure, anorexia ner-
vosa, food insecurity)
	3.	 Increased requirement/hyper-­metabolism (e.g., burns)
	4.	 Excessive loss (e.g., chronic diarrhea, burn, proteinuria)

F.  Diagnostic Evaluation of Malnutrition26-­29
	1.	 There is no consensus on work-­up algorithm.
	2.	 Routine labs and imaging are often low yield and generally not recom-
mended; work-­up should be guided by clinical suspicion.
	3.	 If warranted, reasonable initial testing could include complete blood count, 
complete metabolic panel, urinalysis, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate.
 

--- Page 685 ---
528    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	4.	 If the child’s length has decelerated and is below 50%, can screen for 
hypothyroidism and growth hormone deficiency.
	5.	 If recurrent or severe upper respiratory or opportunistic infections, 
consider testing for human immunodeficiency and tuberculosis and 
measuring immunoglobulin and complement levels.
	6.	 Based on clinical suspicion, can consider celiac screening, sweat chlo-
ride testing, echocardiogram, hepatitis serology, stool studies.
	7.	 Consider hospitalization for observed feeding if the child fails outpatient 
management, suspicion for abuse/neglect or traumatic injury, severe 
psychological caregiver impairment, serious malnutrition, or at risk for 
re-­feeding. 
G.  Red Flags That Suggest a Medical Cause of Malnutrition20
	1.	 Developmental delay or dysmorphic features
	2.	 Cardiac findings (e.g., murmur, edema, jugular venous distension)
	3.	 Failure to gain weight despite adequate calories
	4.	 Organomegaly or lymphadenopathy
	5.	 Recurrent or severe respiratory, mucocutaneous, or urinary infections
	6.	 Recurrent vomiting, diarrhea, or dehydration 
H.  Approach to the Management of Malnourished Patients21,22 (Box 
21.1)
	1.	 Address the etiology of malnutrition.
	2.	 Approximately 20% to 30% more energy may be required to achieve 
catch-­up growth in children. This should continue until the previous 
growth percentiles are regained.
	3.	 Catch-­up linear growth may lag several months behind weight.
	4.	 See Box 21.1 for instructions on the calculation of catch-­up growth 
requirements.
BOX 21.1
DETERMINING CATCH-­UP GROWTH REQUIREMENTS
	1.	 Plot the child’s height and weight on the appropriate growth charts.
	2.	 Determine recommended calories required for age [recommended dietary 
allowances (RDA)].
	3.	 Determine the ideal weight (50th percentile) for child’s height.
	4.	 Multiply the RDA calories by ideal body weight for height (kg).
	5.	 Divide this value by the child’s actual weight (kg). For example, for a 
12-­month-­old boy whose weight is 7 kg and length is 72 cm, RDA for age would 
be 98 kcal/kg/day, and ideal body weight for height is 9 kg (50th percentile 
weight for height); thus his catch-­up growth requirement would be as follows:
98 kcal/kg/day × (9 kg/7 kg) = 126 kcal/kg/day

	5.	 Screen for food insecurity and offer social work and community 
resources.
	6.	 Pharmacotherapy (e.g., cyproheptadine, megestrol) may be helpful for 
patients with significant underlying diseases (e.g., cancer, cystic fibrosis). 
IV.  RE-­FEEDING SYNDROME
A.  Patients at Risk of Developing Re-­Feeding Syndrome23
	1.	 Chronic malnutrition (e.g., prolonged fasting ≥5 days, malignancy)
	2.	 Renal/endocrine (e.g., chronic diuretic use, diabetic hyperglycemic 
hyperosmolar syndrome)
	3.	 Gastrointestinal loss (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, chronic pancre-
atitis, short bowel)
	4.	 Infectious (e.g., AIDS, tuberculosis)
	5.	 Cardiac (e.g., congenital heart disease)
	6.	 Pulmonary (e.g., cystic fibrosis)
	7.	 Psychiatric (e.g., anorexia nervosa, chronic alcohol use)
	8.	 Social (e.g., child abuse/neglect, homelessness, food insecurity) 
B.  Management of Re-­Feeding Syndrome24
	 1.	 Maintain continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring or check vital signs 
every 4 hours, depending on level of concern.
	 2.	 Ensure strict intake and output monitoring with calorie count and daily 
weights.
	 3.	 Obtain at least daily basic metabolic panel with phosphorous and 
magnesium. Obtain more frequently if electrolyte replacement needed, 
or if there are concerning trends.
	 4.	 Measure pre-­albumin, albumin, zinc.
	 5.	 Consider giving thiamine 100 to 300 mg PO daily (or 50 to 100 mg IV) × 
3 days before feeding. There is some debate whether this is required.
	 6.	 Give a multivitamin daily.
	 7.	 Feeding should not proceed without appropriate supplementation.
	 8.	 Recommendations vary, but start at 1/4 to 1/2 of estimated caloric 
needs depending on degree of risk.
	 9.	 Dietary advancement over 3 to 7 days with caloric increases of 10% to 
25% per day until recommended caloric goals achieved.
	10.	 Enteral feeding is preferred over parenteral feeding. 
V.  NUTRITIONAL NEEDS OF HEALTHY CHILDREN
A.  Dietary Allowances for Carbohydrates and Protein (Table 21.3)
B.  Fat Requirements (Table 21.4)
C.  Vitamin Requirements (Tables 21.5 and 21.6)
	1.	 Vitamin D25,26
	
a.	 Breast-­fed and partially breast-­fed infants should be supplemented 
with 400 international units (IU) per day beginning in the first few 
days of life until 12 months.
 

--- Page 687 ---
530    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	
b.	 Formula-­fed infants should be supplemented until the infant is taking 
34 oz of formula per day.
	
c.	 For preterm infants tolerating full enteral feeds and weighing >1500-
2000 g, supplement with 400 IU/day. Supplement with 200-400 IU/
day for infants <1500g.
	
d.	 Supplement children and adolescents with 600 IU/day if the child is 
ingesting <1000 mL (34 oz) per day of vitamin D fortified milk or not 
taking that amount through fortified foods.

aIf sufficient scientific evidence is not available to establish a recommended dietary allowance (RDA), an adequate intake 
(AI) is usually developed. For healthy breast-­fed infants, the AI is the mean intake. The AI for other life stage and gender 
groups is believed to cover the needs of all healthy individuals in the group, but a lack of data or uncertainty in the data 
prevents from being able to specify with confidence the percentage of individuals covered by this intake.
bNo AI, estimated average requirement (EAR), or RDA established.

gAlthough AIs have been set for choline, there are few data to assess whether a dietary supply of choline is required at all life stages, and it may be that the choline requirement can be met by endogenous synthesis at 
some of these stages.
NOTE: This table presents recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) in bold type and adequate intakes (AIs) in regular type followed by an asterisk (*). RDAs and AIs may both be used as goals for individual intake. 
RDAs are set to meet the needs of almost all (97% to 98%) individuals in a group. For healthy breast-­fed infants, the AI is the mean intake. The AI for other life stage and gender groups is believed to cover needs of all 
individuals in the group, but lack of data or uncertainty in the data prevent from being able to specify with confidence the percentage of individuals covered by this intake.

e.	 At risk children (e.g., cystic fibrosis) and those with labora-
tory confirmed vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency should also be 
supplemented.
	
f.	 See Table 21.6 for interpreting vitamin D levels.
	2.	 Folate27,28
	
a.	 All women capable of becoming pregnant should consume 400 mCg 
from supplements or diet.
	
b.	 This should continue as women enter prenatal care.
	
c.	 If a woman had a prior pregnancy with a neutral tube defect and 
is planning another pregnancy, she should consume 4 mg of folic 
acid daily (requires a prescription) at least 4 weeks before becoming 
pregnant and continue through the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. 
D.  Mineral Requirements (Table 21.7)
	1.	 Iron29
	
a.	 Breast-­fed term infants should receive 1 mg/kg/day of an oral iron 
supplement beginning at 4 months of age, preferably from iron-­
fortified cereal or, alternatively, elemental iron.
	
b.	 Breast-­fed preterm infants should receive 2 mg/kg/day by 1 month of 
age, which should continue until the infant is weaned to iron-­fortified 
formula or begins eating complementary foods.
	
c.	 Formula-­fed term infants receive adequate iron from fortified formula.
	
d.	 Formula-­fed preterm infants need 2 mg/kg/day, which is the amount 
supplied by iron-fortified formulas.
	2.	 Fluoride30
	
a.	 Consider fluoride supplementation for those patients who use bottled 
water or home filtration systems. Some home water treatment sys-
tems can reduce fluoride levels.
	
b.	 For infants and children at high risk for the development of caries, 
fluoride supplementation ranging from 0.25-1 mg/day is recom-
mended according to the American Dental Association’s schedule.
	
c.	 Fluoridated toothpaste is recommended for all children starting at 
tooth eruption, using a smear (grain-of-rice-sized) until age 3 and 
then a pea-­sized amount after that time.

aCut-­off values are not yet well-defined. Controversy exists regarding the optimal 25-­hydroxy vitamin D level. Some 
experts recommend a level of 20 to 30 ng/mL as being sufficient. These are the Johns Hopkins Hospital Pediatrics 
guidelines used for dosing.
NOTE: 1,25-­dihydroxy vitamin D is the physiologically active form, but 25-­hydroxy vitamin D is the value to monitor for 
vitamin D deficiency as it approximates body stores of vitamin D.

NOTE: This table presents recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) in bold type and adequate intakes (AIs) in ordinary type followed by an asterisk (*). RDAs and AIs may both be used as goals for individual intake. 
RDAs are set to meet the needs of almost all (97% to 98%) individuals in a group. For healthy breast-­fed infants, the AI is the mean intake. The AI for other life stage and gender groups is believed to cover needs of all 
individuals in the group, but lack of data or uncertainty in the data prevent from being able to specify with confidence the percentage of individuals covered by this intake.

E.  Fiber Requirements (Table 21.8) 
VI.  BREASTFEEDING AND THE USE OF HUMAN MILK
A.  Benefits of Breast Milk31
	1.	 Decreased risk of infections (e.g., otitis media, respiratory), necrotizing 
enterocolitis, inflammatory bowel, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).
	2.	 Decreased incidence of atopic conditions, obesity, and diabetes. 
B.  Contraindications to Breastfeeding32,33 (Box 21.2)
	1.	 Tobacco smoking is not contraindicated but is strongly discouraged 
because of an association with increased risks of SIDS, respiratory 
disease, and infections in exposed infants.
	2.	 Alcohol should be limited to the occasional intake of 2 oz of liquor, 8 oz 
of wine, or two beers for the average 60 kg woman >2 hours prior to the 
onset of nursing.
	3.	 Methadone and buprenorphine are not contraindications, if the mother 
is in a stable maintenance program and not using street drugs. 
C.  Use of Milk Bank Donor Human Milk34
	1.	 Most commonly used in low birth weight infants (<1.5 kg).
	2.	 Can be considered in infants with intestinal disease with documented 
intolerance to specialized infant formulas. 
D.  Safe Handling of Breast Milk35
	1.	 Freshly expressed or pumped milk can be stored at room temperature 
for up to 4 hours, in the refrigerator for up to 4 days, in the freezer for 
approximately 6 months (up to 12 months), and in an insulated cooler 
bag with frozen packs up to 24 hours while traveling.
	2.	 Once breast milk is thawed to room temperature or warmed, it should 
be used within 2 hours.

aAdequate intake (AI). If sufficient scientific evidence unavailable to establish recommended dietary allowance (RDA), 
an AI is usually developed. For healthy breast-­fed infants, the AI is the mean intake. AI for other life stage and gender 
groups is believed to cover the needs of all healthy individuals in the group, but a lack of data or uncertainty in the data 
prevents from being able to specify with confidence the percentage of individuals covered by this intake.

be used within 2 hours of the baby finishing the feed. 
E.  Breastfeeding Challenges
See Section IX.C. 
VII.  ENTERAL NUTRITION
A.  Feeding the Healthy Infant
	1.	 Recommended formula amount by age36
	
a.	 1st days of life: 1 to 2 ounces every 2 to 3 hours
	
b.	 1st month: 2 to 4 ounces every 3 to 4 hours
	
c.	 2nd month: 5 to 6 ounces every 4 to 5 hours
	
d.	 3rd to 5th month: 6 to 7 ounces every 4 to 5 hours
	
e.	 6th to 8th month: 24 to 32 ounces in 24 hours
	
f.	 8th to 10th month: 16 to 32 ounces in 24 hours
	
g.	 10th to 12th month: 12 to 24 ounces in 24 hours
	2.	 Properties of formula options for healthy infants and toddlers (Table 21.9)
	3.	 Appropriate preparation and fortification of formulas (Table 21.10)
	4.	 Methods to further increase calories, protein, carbohydrate, fat, or a 
combination (Table 21.11) 
B.  Available Formulas for Patients with Specific Clinical Conditions or 
for Those Requiring Special Diets (Tables 21.12 and 21.13)
C.  Use of Enteral Tube Feeds37
	1.	 Insufficient oral intake (e.g., anorexia nervosa, food aversion, malab-
sorption, increased needs)
	2.	 As a primary therapy (e.g., metabolic or inflammatory bowel disease, 
fasting intolerance)
	3.	 Oral motor dysfunction (e.g., prematurity, neuromuscular and neuro-
logic disease)

aAcceptable osmolarity of parenteral nutrition through a peripheral line varies between 900 and 1050 osm/L by institu-
tion. An estimate of the osmolarity of parenteral nutrition can be obtained with the following formula: Estimated osmolar-
ity = (dextrose concentration × 50) + (amino acid concentration × 100) + (mEq of electrolytes × 2). Consult individual 
pharmacy for hospital limitations.
bIn general, infants require the higher concentration and/or rate of glucose, protein, and fat compared to older children 
and adolescents
cEssential fatty acid deficiency may occur in fat-­free parenteral nutrition within 2 to 4 weeks in infants and children and 
as early as 2 to 14 days in neonates. A minimum of 2% to 4% of total caloric intake as linoleic acid and 0.25% to 0.5% 
as linolenic acid is necessary to meet essential fatty acid requirements.
dIf parenteral nutrition–associated cholestasis occurs, lipid minimization and/or use of fish oil or composite lipids should 
be considered.41

C.  Initial Workup
	1.	 Thorough neurologic exam, including fundoscopic exam.
	2.	 Neurosurgery/Neuro-­oncology consultation.
	3.	 Labs: Presurgical tests (complete blood count [CBC], electrolytes, blood 
type, coagulation factors, cross-­matching); endocrine tests for suprasel-
lar tumors; α fetoprotein (AFP) and β human chorionic gonadotropin (β 
hCG) if germinoma suspected.
	4.	 Imaging: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain (sometimes spine) 
with and without intravenous (IV) contrast. 
D.  Management Principles
	1.	 High-­dose dexamethasone: Often administered to reduce tumor-­
associated edema.
	2.	 Consider seizure prophylaxis for those at high risk of seizures or seizure 
history. 
V.  ONCOLOGIC EMERGENCIES2,9-­16
A.  Fever and Neutropenia (Fig 22.1)
	1.	 Etiology: Fever with temperature ≥38.3°C (some centers and medical 
associations also use 38.0°C sustained over an hour to define fever) 
in the setting of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] <500 
cells/μL or <1000 cells/μL but expected to drop to <500 cells/μL in 
the next 48 hours). Presumed serious infection in a neutropenic host. 
While fevers may be caused by other etiologies including medications, 
presume infection until proven otherwise.
	2.	 Presentation: May appear ill with fatigue, lethargy, or localized pain. Can 
also appear well, yet have subtle signs of compensated shock, including 
chills, rigors, tachypnea, or tachycardia. May deteriorate after initial 
doses of antibiotics.
	3.	 Management: Broad-­spectrum antibiotics with antipseudomonal cover-
age should be administered within 60 minutes of presentation to medi-
cal facility. Note: Antibiotic administration may lead to clinical sepsis 
secondary to release of endotoxin from gram-­negative bacteria. 
B.  Hyperleukocytosis/Leukostasis
	1.	 Etiology: Elevated white blood cell (WBC) count (usually >100,000/μL) 
in leukemia patients leads to leukostasis in the microcirculation and 
diminished tissue perfusion (notably in CNS and lungs). Leukostasis 
occurs more commonly and at lower WBC counts in acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML) than in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL).
	2.	 Presentation: Hypoxia, tachypnea, dyspnea, and pulmonary 
hemorrhage from pulmonary leukostasis. Mental status changes, 
headaches, seizures, and papilledema from cerebral leukostasis. 
May also see GI bleeding, abdominal pain, renal insufficiency, 
priapism, and/or intracranial hemorrhage. Hyperleukocytosis may be 
asymptomatic.

	3.	 Management
	
a.	 Prompt initiation of chemotherapy is the most effective approach.
	
b.	 Consider leukapheresis or exchange transfusion if evidence of symp-
tomatic leukostasis.
	
c.	 Transfuse platelets to keep count above 20,000/μL to prevent 
hemorrhage.1
	
d.	 Avoid red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, which raise viscosity. If 
required, consider partial exchange transfusion.
	
e.	 Hydration and allopurinol should be initiated, as hyperleukocytosis 
increases the risk of tumor lysis syndrome.
	
f.	 Treat coagulopathy. 
C.  Tumor Lysis Syndrome
	1.	 Etiology: Rapid lysis of tumor cells releases intracellular contents into 
the blood stream spontaneously before treatment or during early stages 
of chemotherapy (especially Burkitt lymphoma, T-­cell leukemia/lym-
phoma, acute leukemias with hyperleukocytosis).
	2.	 Presentation: Hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia (with sec-
ondary hypocalcemia). Can lead to acute kidney injury. Symptoms include 
nausea, anorexia, arrhythmias, seizures, and altered mental status.
	3.	 Diagnosis: CBC, basic metabolic panel (BMP), phosphorus, uric acid, 
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), electrocardiogram (ECG).
	4.	 Prevention and Management
	
a.	 Hydration: Dextrose-­containing IV fluids (without potassium, calcium, 
phosphate) at twice maintenance rate. Keep urine-­specific gravity 
<1.010 and urine output >100 mL/m2/hr. Alkalinization is no longer 
recommended, given increased risk of calcium phosphate precipitation.
	
b.	 Hyperuricemia: Allopurinol inhibits formation of uric acid and should 
only be given PO (see Formulary for dosing). Rasburicase converts 
uric acid to the more soluble allantoin. Use in high-­risk patients, 
especially those with uric acid >7.5 mg/dL. Do not use rasburi-
case with patients with known G6PD deficiency, as it may result in 
methemoglobinemia.
	
c.	 Monitor potassium, calcium, phosphorous, uric acid, and urinalysis 
closely (up to Q2 hours for high-­risk patients). There is an increased 
risk of calcium phosphate precipitation when Ca × Phos > 60. 
Consider early use of sevelamer.
	
d.	 See Chapter 11 for management of abnormal electrolytes and 
Chapter 19 for dialysis indications. 
D.  Spinal Cord Compression
	1.	 Etiology: Intrinsic or extrinsic compression of spinal cord. Occurs most 
commonly with metastases from brain tumors, spinal tumors, soft tissue 
sarcomas, neuroblastoma, lymphoma.
	2.	 Presentation: Back pain (localized or radicular), weakness, sensory loss, 
bowel or bladder dysfunction, gait abnormalities. Prognosis for recovery 
based on duration and level of disability at presentation.
 

--- Page 714 ---
554    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	3.	 Diagnosis: MRI (preferred) or computed tomography (CT) scan of spine. 
Spine radiography is less sensitive.
	4.	 Management
	
a.	 In the presence of neurologic abnormalities, strong history, and rapid 
progression of symptoms, consider immediate dexamethasone. Note: 
Steroids may prevent accurate diagnosis of leukemia/lymphoma; 
plan diagnostic procedure as soon as possible.
	
b.	 If tumor type is known and chemosensitive, emergent chemotherapy 
is indicated.
	
c.	 If tumor type is unknown or debulking may remove most/all of tumor, 
emergent neurosurgery consultation is indicated to decompress the 
spine. 
E.  Increased Intracranial Pressure (ICP)
	1.	 Etiology: Ventricular obstruction or impaired cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) 
flow. Most commonly seen with brain tumors, but also with intracranial 
hemorrhage, thrombosis, meningeal involvement by tumor or infection.
	2.	 Presentation: Headaches, altered mental status, irritability, lethargy, 
nuchal rigidity, emesis, abnormal vision; Cushing triad and pupillary 
changes are late and ominous findings.
	3.	 Diagnosis
	
a.	 Evaluate for vital sign changes [i.e., Cushing triad (↓ heart rate, ↑ 
systolic blood pressure, irregular respirations)].
	
b.	 Funduscopic evaluation for papilledema.
	
c.	 Obtain CT or MRI of the head (MRI more sensitive for diagnosis of 
posterior fossa tumors).
	4.	 Management
	
a.	 See Chapter 1 for management principles.
	
b.	 Obtain emergent neurosurgical consultation.
	
c.	 If tumor is the cause, start IV dexamethasone (see Formulary for dosing). 
F.  Other Neurologic Emergencies: Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA), 
Seizures
	1.	 CVA Etiology: Hyperleukocytosis, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, radi-
ation (fibrosis) or chemotherapy-­related (e.g., l-­asparaginase–induced 
hemorrhage or thrombosis, methotrexate). Most common in patients 
with AML or any form of leukemia with hyperleukocytosis.
	2.	 Seizure Etiology: Most common in primary CNS tumors, tumors meta-
static to CNS, meningeal leukemia, chemotherapy-­related (intrathecal 
[IT] cytarabine, IT/IV methotrexate).
	3.	 See Chapters 1 and 20 for diagnosis and management. 
G.  Superior Vena Cava Syndrome/Superior Mediastinal Syndrome
	1.	 Etiology: Compression of venous drainage and trachea, most commonly 
caused by mediastinal mass. Usually seen with T-­lymphoblastic lymphoma, 
Hodgkin lymphoma, mature B-­cell lymphoma, and germ cell tumors.
	2.	 Presentation: Dyspnea, cough, wheeze, stridor, orthopnea, headaches, 
facial swelling, dizziness, plethora.
 

--- Page 715 ---
Chapter 22  Oncology    555
22
	3.	 Diagnosis: Two-­view chest radiograph. If mediastinal mass present, 
obtain neck radiograph to further assess. Avoid sedation if unstable, 
high risk for airway obstruction.
	4.	 Management
	
a.	 Control airway, place in upright position, and administer supplemen-
tal oxygen.
	
b.	 Biopsy (e.g., bone marrow, pleurocentesis, lymph node biopsy) 
before therapy if patient can tolerate sedation.
	
c.	 Empiric therapy: Radiotherapy, steroids, chemotherapy. Note: can 
confound diagnosis. 
H.  Typhlitis (Neutropenic Enterocolitis)
	1.	 Etiology: Inflammation of bowel wall, typically localized to cecum. 
Associated with bacterial or fungal invasion. Associated with prolonged 
neutropenia, often secondary to induction therapy in leukemia.
	2.	 Presentation: Right lower quadrant abdominal pain, nausea/emesis, 
diarrhea, fever (may be absent early in course). Risk for perforation.
	3.	 Diagnosis
	
a.	 Careful serial abdominal examinations.
	
b.	 Abdominal ultrasound may be considered (may show pneumatosis 
intestinalis, bowel wall edema). CT abdomen with IV and PO contrast 
is most sensitive form of imaging.
	4.	 Management
	
a.	 Bowel rest: NPO on IV fluids; consider nasogastric decompression.
	
b.	 Broad anerobic and gram-­negative antibiotic coverage.
	
c.	 Surgical consultation. 
I.  Cytokine Release Syndrome
	1.	 Etiology: Newer immunologic agents (e.g., chimeric antigen receptor T 
[CAR-­T] therapy and specific antibodies) can provoke release of cytokines 
associated with systemic inflammation and hemodynamic instability.
	2.	 Presentation: Early symptoms include fever, diaphoresis, or mild 
evidence of hemodynamic instability (tachycardia) that can progress 
quickly to cardiovascular collapse and multi-­organ dysfunction.
	3.	 Diagnosis: Based on clinical features. Consider obtaining CRP and fer-
ritin, although nondiagnostic.
	4.	 Management
	
a.	 Tocilizumab: recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody targeting 
the IL-­6 receptor.
	
b.	 Treat hypotension with IV fluids. If refractory, may require vasopres-
sors, intensive care unit (ICU)-­level care.
	
c.	 Closely monitor neurologic status because these agents are associ-
ated with neurotoxicity. Patient should be on seizure prophylaxis.

Note: Transfuse only irradiated and leukoreduced packed red blood cells 
(pRBCs) and single-­donor platelets; cytomegalovirus (CMV)-­negative or 
leukofiltered pRBCs/platelets for CMV-­negative patients. Use leukofiltered 
pRBCs/platelets for those who may undergo transplant in the future to 
prevent alloimmunization or for those who have had nonhemolytic febrile 
transfusion reactions. Many oncology patients have nonhemolytic reactions 
(fever, rash, hypotension, respiratory distress) to pRBCs and/or platelet 
transfusion and should subsequently be premedicated with diphenhydr-
amine and/or acetaminophen.

b.	 Anemia: Hemoglobin thresholds for pRBC transfusions in cancer 
patients are based on clinical status and symptoms (often ≤8 g/dL).
	
c.	 Thrombocytopenia: In general, maintain platelet count above 
10,000/μL. Patients with active bleeding, fever, or before selected pro-
cedures (e.g., lumbar puncture, intramuscular injection) may require 
higher thresholds. Consider maintaining at higher levels for patients 
who have brain tumors, recent brain surgery, or history of stroke.
	
d.	 Neutropenia:
	
(1)	 Broad-­spectrum antibiotics with concomitant fever (see Fig. 22.1).
	
(2)	 GCSF to assist in recovery of neutrophils. 
B.  Mucositis
	1.	 Etiology: Damage to endothelial cells of the GI tract from chemotherapy, 
leading to breakdown of the mucosa. Typically peaks in the first 1 to 2 
weeks after chemotherapy.
	2.	 Presentation: Oropharyngeal pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, intolerance of PO intake.
	3.	 Prevention and Management: Supportive care aimed at pain control and 
nutrition. Local pain control with lidocaine-­containing mouthwashes 
and bicarbonate rinses. Systemic pain control often requires patient-­
controlled analgesia (PCA) infusion. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is 
commonly required. 
C.  Nausea and Emesis
	1.	 Etiology: Chemotherapy side effect. Also suspect opiate therapy, GI and 
CNS radiotherapy, obstructive abdominal process, elevated ICP, certain 
antibiotics, or hypercalcemia.
	2.	 Presentation: Can be acute (within 24 hours of chemotherapy initiation), 
delayed (beyond 24 hours), or anticipatory in subsequent cycles.
	3.	 Therapy: Hydration plus one or more antiemetic medications (Table 
22.5; see Formulary for dosing).

to stem cell infusion. Generally, provides greater anticancer activity but 
carries a higher risk of treatment-­related organ injury.
	2.	 Nonmyeloablative: Reduced-­intensity conditioning regimen where mar-
row is not fully ablated, allowing recovery of autologous hematopoiesis 
if patient fails to engraft. Associated with decreased treatment-­related 
mortality but higher risk of relapse or transplant rejection. 
C.  Types of HSCT
	1.	 Allogeneic
	
a.	 Recipient is transfused with donor stem cells from genetically similar 
but nonidentical donor, following a preparative regimen that includes 
chemotherapy and often radiation. Donors are screened for human 
leukocyte antigen (HLA) subtype matching to recipient. Possible 
donors include HLA-­matched siblings, fully or partially HLA-­matched 
unrelated donors, umbilical cord blood units, and HLA-­haploidentical 
(half-­matched) related donors.
	
b.	 Increased level of mismatch between donor and recipient increases 
the risk for graft-­versus-­host disease (GVHD) but may offer greater 
graft-­versus-­leukemia (GVL) immunologic treatment effect.
	
c.	 Used commonly for leukemias, myelodysplastic syndrome, hemo-
phagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and a number of nonmalignant 
hematologic, immunologic, and metabolic disorders.
	2.	 Autologous
	
a.	 Donor is recipient. After several cycles of conventional chemother-
apy, stem cells from patient are harvested from the patient, stored, 
and given back after the patient has received intense myeloablative 
doses of chemotherapy.
	
b.	 Generally, lacks GVHD or GVL effect.
	
c.	 Used for high-­risk neuroblastoma, lymphoma, and various high-­risk 
solid tumors, which have demonstrated improved disease control 
after higher intensity chemotherapy that would otherwise be limited 
by excessive marrow suppression. 
D.  Engraftment
	1.	 Recipient’s bone marrow is repopulated with donor stem cells that 
proliferate and mature.
	2.	 Usually starts within 2 to 4 weeks of transplant and may present with 
an inflammatory response, but can be significantly delayed with certain 
conditions, drug toxicity, or infection.
	3.	 Defined as an ANC more than 500/μl for 3 consecutive days.

	1.	 Etiology: Donor T-­cell-­mediated reaction to unique host antigens. Risk 
factors include HLA disparity, source of stem cells (peripheral blood > 
bone marrow > umbilical cord blood), magnitude of conditioning-­related 
tissue injury, and posttransplant infections.
 

--- Page 722 ---
562    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	2.	 Presentation: Acute GVHD most commonly occurs within 6 weeks of 
transplantation, typically within 100 days of transplantation; rarely, it 
may occur or persist beyond this time. Chronic GVHD traditionally pres-
ents >100 days after transplant but may occur earlier and persist.
	
a.	 Maculopapular skin rash. Can progress to bullous lesions resembling 
toxic epidermal necrolysis.
	
b.	 GI symptoms: Anorexia, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal 
cramping, secretory diarrhea.
	
c.	 Laboratory findings: Direct hyperbilirubinemia.
	
d.	 Chronic GVHD can involve nearly any organ. Commonly includes 
sclerodermatous skin changes, cholestasis/hepatitis, lung involve-
ment (restrictive or obstructive), and/or dry eyes and mouth.
	3.	 Diagnosis: Triad of rash, abdominal cramping with diarrhea, hyper-
bilirubinemia. Tissue biopsy of skin or mucosa can provide histologic 
confirmation, demonstrating lymphocytic infiltration and apoptosis. See 
Section XIII for clinical staging.
	4.	 Prevention and Management
	
a.	 Prophylaxis: Immunosuppression with posttransplant cyclophos-
phamide, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and/or 
sirolimus; adjuvants include methotrexate and prednisone.
	
b.	 First-­line treatment: Grade 1 and 2 GVHD may be treated locally with 
topical steroids (skin) or nonabsorbable enteral steroids (gut). First-­
line systemic treatment is corticosteroids, often with an additional 
immunosuppressant.
	
c.	 Note: Patients with cGVHD are functionally asplenic and significantly 
immunosuppressed, requiring antimicrobial prophylaxis. 
B.  Sinusoidal Obstructive Syndrome (SOS); Veno-­Occlusive Disease 
(VOD)
	1.	 Etiology: Injury to endothelial cells leads to activation of the clotting 
cascade in liver sinusoids, causing erythrocyte congestion and occlu-
sive fibrosis of terminal intrahepatic venules and sinusoids. Occurs 
as a consequence of hematopoietic cell transplantation, hepatotoxic 
chemotherapy, and/or high-­dose liver radiation. Typically occurs within 
3 weeks of the insult, most common at the end of the first week after 
transplant.
	2.	 Presentation: Tender hepatomegaly, hyperbilirubinemia, edema, ascites, 
unexplained weight gain, thrombocytopenia refractory to transfusions.
	3.	 Diagnosis: There are two established clinical diagnostic criteria, the 
Modified Seattle and Baltimore. Updated criteria based on growing 
understanding of the pathophysiology have recently been proposed.26,30 
As each has limitations, consideration of all factors enables earlier diag-
nosis, treatment, and improved outcomes.
	
a.	 Modified Seattle Criteria: Two of the following events within 20 days of 
HSCT: Bilirubin >2 mg/dL; tender hepatomegaly; weight gain >2%.
	
b.	 Baltimore Criteria: Bilirubin >2 mg/dL within 21 days of HSCT plus 
two of the following: Hepatomegaly; ascites; weight gain >5%.

c.	 Proposed updated criteria, unpublished as of this writing, have an 
expanded time frame with no time restriction to symptom develop-
ment and broaden the definition by including transfusion refractory 
thrombocytopenia and imaging/biopsy results as eligible criteria.
	
d.	 Severe SOS is defined by the above, plus pulmonary and/or renal 
organ failure.
	
e.	 Imaging: Doppler US showing reversal of flow in the portal venous 
system is often found with severe SOS (although its absence does 
not rule out SOS).
	4.	 Prevention and Treatment
	
a.	 Prevention: Ursodeoxycholic acid from conditioning through 90 days 
post transplant.
	
b.	 Treatment: Mild/moderate SOS can be managed with supportive 
care, including fluid and sodium restriction and diuretics. Defibrotide 
is the only approved pharmacologic treatment modality, with 
improved outcomes with earlier initiation and a 50% response rate. 
Maintain coagulation factors, platelets, and RBCs in stable range 
secondary to consumption.
	
c.	 See Section XIII, for discussion of additional complications, including 
engraftment syndrome, thrombotic microangiopathy, hemorrhagic 
cystitis, and idiopathic pneumonia syndrome. 
XI.  CANCER SURVIVORSHIP3,23-­25
A.  Understand the Diagnosis
Obtain comprehensive treatment summary from oncologist summarizing 
diagnosis, chemotherapeutic agents, radiation, surgeries, history of HSCT, 
and adverse drug reactions. 
B.  Monitoring
	1.	 Determine any potential problems by organ system, and devise plan for 
routine evaluation.
	2.	 See Table 22.7 and www.survivorshipguidelines.org for common late 
effects of therapy.

XIII.  ONLINE CONTENT
A.  Complications of HSCT1,2,19-­21,25-­29
	1.	 Graft-­Versus-­Host Disease (GVHD)
See Table EC 22.A for grading of acute GVHD. Acute GVHD should be 
graded weekly through day +100. If systemic treatment is started, it should 
be graded twice weekly while on treatment.
	2.	 Engraftment Syndrome
	
a.	 Etiology: Occurs several days prior to donor cell engraftment and in 
days following white blood cell recovery owing to endothelial injury 
and activated granulocytes in the setting of proinflammatory cyto-
kines. Occurs in approximately 20% of HSCT patients.
	
b.	 Presentation: Fever and rash; can have pulmonary infiltrates, diar-
rhea, or signs of shock.
	
c.	 Diagnosis: Similar presentation to GVHD and infection. Imperative 
to rule out infection while treating empirically with antibiotics. Often 
mild and self-­limited. However, if symptoms continue for ≥ 48 hours 
or are severe, consider initiation of corticosteroids. If insufficient ste-
roid response after 72 hours, can biopsy for alternative diagnoses.
	
d.	 Treatment: Treatment with supportive care and corticosteroids; opti-
mization of GVHD prophylaxis. If biopsy confirms immune-­mediated 
pathology, can treat with additional immunosuppressive agents.
	3.	 Transplant-­Associated Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TA-TMA)
	
a.	 Etiology: Associated with immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclosporine, 
tacrolimus) and infection.
	
b.	 Presentation: Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and consumptive 
thrombocytopenia. Often associated with renal insufficiency/failure; 
may be associated with neurologic symptoms.
	
c.	 Diagnosis: Anemia and thrombocytopenia on CBC, schistocytes on periph-
eral blood smear, hematuria, proteinuria, casts on urinalysis, elevated 
LDH, decreased haptoglobin, impaired renal function, elevated d-­dimer on 
coagulation panel.
	
d.	 Treatment: Supportive care with blood products, fluid management, and 
dialysis. Address underlying etiology—consider alternative immunosup-
pressant and treat any underlying infection. For progressive or severe 
TA-TMA, consider neutralization of compliment with eculizumab.31
	4.	 Hemorrhagic Cystitis
	
a.	 Etiology: Pretransplant conditioning regimens (specifically those that 
include cyclophosphamide, pelvic or total body irradiation [TBI]) or 
viral reactivation (adenovirus, BK virus).
	
b.	 Presentation: Hematuria, dysuria, difficulty voiding due to clots.
	
c.	 Diagnosis: Urine polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for adeno-
virus and BK virus, bacterial cultures, bladder ultrasound, CBC, 
coagulation studies.
	
d.	 Treatment: Hydration, analgesics, platelet transfusion, treatment of 
any underlying infections. For obstruction, Foley catheter with blad-
der irrigation.
 

--- Page 727 ---
565.e2    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	5.	 Idiopathic Pneumonia Syndrome
	
a.	 Etiology: Widespread alveolar injury in the absence of infection or other 
known etiology. Thought to occur from a variety of insults, including toxic 
effects of the conditioning regimen, immunologic cell–mediated injury, 
and inflammation secondary to cytokine release following engraftment. 
Most commonly occurs within the first 120 days after transplant.
	
b.	 Presentation: Rapidly progressive dry cough, dyspnea, hypoxemia, 
diffuse radiographic opacities; may progress to ARDS.
	
c.	 Diagnosis: Imaging; bronchoalveolar lavage with transbronchial 
biopsy, if tolerated.
	
d.	 Prevention and Management: Supportive care together with broad-­
spectrum antibiotics while infectious studies pending. IV corticoste-
roids and tumor necrosis factor-­α inhibitor etanercept if no infection 
identified.32

Palliative Care
Joshua Natbony, MD
I.  INTRODUCTION TO HOSPICE AND PALLIATIVE MEDICINE
A.  Definition of Palliative Care1,2
	1.	 Palliative care is the active total care of the child’s body, mind, and spirit 
with the intent to prevent and relieve suffering, with a special focus on 
symptom control.
	2.	 Palliative medicine supports the best quality of life for the child and 
family. It can be provided along with disease-­directed treatment from 
the time of diagnosis of serious illness.
	3.	 See Fig. 23.1 for the current accepted model of palliative care. 
B.  Definition of Hospice
	1.	 Hospice care is an insurance benefit that may be initiated for patients 
who have a terminal illness with a life expectancy estimated to be 6 
months or less.
	2.	 It specializes in care at the end of life to promote a child’s comfort and 
to support loved ones in their bereavement. 
C.  Team Composition
	1.	 Hospice and palliative care teams are often robust and  
interdisciplinary.
	2.	 They generally include physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, physi-
cian assistants, social workers, child life specialists, pastoral care, 
patient care coordinators, and bereavement coordinators.

II.  COMMUNICATION AND DECISION MAKING
A.  Decision-­Making Tools3
	1.	 Provide framework for discussion with families regarding medical 
issues, quality of life, family goals, preferences, and other contextual 
preferences, such as spirituality and culture.
	2.	 Advance directives:
	
a.	 Adolescents aged 18 years and older, if they are unable to speak 
for themselves, can name another adult to make healthcare 
decisions.
	
b.	 Children and adolescents younger than 18 years of age can actively 
participate in decision making by using helpful tools such as “Five 
Wishes” and “Voicing My Choices” (see in Section IV). 
B.  Structuring Family Meetings4
	 1.	 Make sure that all necessary individuals are present and understand 
the purpose of the meeting.
	 2.	 Make sure that all clinicians are in agreement about the patient’s 
condition and the recommendations.
	 3.	 Identify the individual who will facilitate the meeting.
	 4.	 Choose a private location with minimal distraction.
	 5.	 Always have water and tissues available.
	 6.	 Begin by introducing all participants and the purpose of the meeting.
	 7.	 Assess what the family knows and expects with respect to the patient’s 
condition.
	 8.	 Describe the clinical situation, providing the big picture and then ask-
ing family members if they would like or are ready for more details.
	 9.	 Encourage each member of the family to express concerns and 
questions.
	10.	 Explore the patient’s and family’s values and how they influence deci-
sion making.
	11.	 Propose goals for the patient’s care that reflect the stated values.
	12.	 Provide a concrete follow-­up plan. 
C.  Breaking Bad News5
	1.	 Prepare yourself: Know the medical information, know what you will say, 
ask the patient/family if they want someone in particular present with 
them for the discussion.
	2.	 Prepare the family/patient: Give a brief, calm statement that leads into 
the news.
	3.	 State the news: Do this clearly and concisely, and be as definitive as 
possible.
	4.	 Wait for the patient/family’s reaction: Resist the urge to say more; allow 
others to speak first.
	5.	 Reflect the response back: “This news is clearly very upsetting to you.”
	6.	 Legitimize the reaction: “It is understandable that you would be upset.”
	7.	 Explore: “What upsets you the most about this news?”
	8.	 Provide realistic hope.
 

--- Page 732 ---
568    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	9.	 Discuss next steps (if appropriate at this time): “May I address your 
concerns now and talk about the next steps for treatment, or would you 
like more time?” 
D.  Other Tools for Difficult Conversations
	1.	 Assess spirituality according to the “FICA” tool6:
	
a.	 Faith and belief: “Do you consider yourself spiritual or religious?”
	
b.	 Importance in life: “What importance does your faith or belief system 
have in your life?”
	
c.	 Community: “Are you a part of a spiritual or religious community?”
	
d.	 Address in care: “How would you like me, your healthcare provider, 
to address these issues in your healthcare?”
	2.	 “Ask-­tell-­ask”7
	
a.	 Ask the patient or family to describe their understanding of the situa-
tion or issue.
	
b.	 Tell them what you need to communicate in a straightforward manner.
	
c.	 Ask them questions to assess their understanding.
	3.	 “Hope together” with the patient and family while also preparing for all 
possible outcomes. 
III.  CARE OF THE DYING CHILD
A.  Limiting Interventions
The following options should be considered.
	1.	 Do not attempt resuscitation (DNAR)—foregoing cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation (CPR) and other resuscitative interventions as part of an 
overall care plan that emphasizes comfort and quality of living.
	2.	 Do not intubate (DNI)—although, if clinically appropriate, intubation 
may still allow the initiation of continuous positive-­pressure ventilation or 
may help in managing symptoms.
	3.	 Do not escalate treatment—the choice to forego changes in treatment, 
even as a patient’s condition worsens, because death is expected. 
Examples of such requests include the following:
	
a.	 Do not increase the dose of current medications  
(e.g., vasopressors).
	
b.	 Do not add new medications (e.g., antibiotics).
	
c.	 Do not initiate new interventions (e.g., dialysis, mechanical 
ventilation).
	
d.	 However, one may still initiate and increase interventions to treat pain 
and reduce suffering.
	4.	 Discontinuing current interventions—the option of discontinuing inter-
ventions that prolong the dying process must also be discussed.
	5.	 Medical orders for life-­sustaining treatment and physician orders for 
life-­sustaining treatment (POLST) forms:
	
a.	 These are portable and enduring medical order forms completed 
by patients or their authorized decision makers and are signed by a 
physician.
 

--- Page 733 ---
Chapter 23  Palliative Care    569
23
	
b.	 They contain orders regarding CPR and other life-­sustaining 
treatments.
	
c.	 If a state offers one of these forms, the orders are valid for emer-
gency medical service providers as well as healthcare providers and 
facilities within that state.
	
d.	 A copy must be provided to the patient or authorized decision 
maker within 48 hours of completion or sooner if the patient is to be 
transferred.
	
e.	 Refer to your state’s laws prior to completing any documentation.
	
f.	 Additional information for US providers can be found at www.polst.
org. 
B.  Involving the Child in Conversations About Death8-­11
	1.	 See Table 23.1 for the development of death concepts in children.12
	2.	 A minor child has the capacity to meaningfully participate in medical 
decision making if he or she demonstrates the ability to do all of the 
following:
	
a.	 Communicate understanding of the medical information.
	
b.	 State his or her preference.
	
c.	 Communicate understanding of the consequences of decisions.
	3.	 Helpful documents are available for purchase from the nonprofit Aging 
with Dignity (see Section IV.B).
	
a.	 Five Wishes: This is a legal advance directive with versions tailored 
for adolescents.
	
b.	 Voicing My Choices: A workbook for adolescents intended to comple-
ment Five Wishes.
	
c.	 My Wishes: A simple booklet for younger children to help them share 
their preferences.

E.  Explaining Autopsies15
	1.	 Definitions
	
a.	 An autopsy is a definitive examination of a deceased patient to deter-
mine the cause of death.
	
b.	 A forensic autopsy is a legally mandated examination to determine 
cause of death in a criminal investigation.
	
c.	 A rapid autopsy involves the urgent removal of tissues for research 
uses.
	2.	 Frequently asked questions
	
a.	 A voluntary autopsy can look at all parts of a patient’s body or only 
some.
	
b.	 An autopsy will not affect the patient’s body cosmetically and should 
not affect funeral or viewing arrangements.
	
c.	 An autopsy takes 2 to 4 hours to perform and should not delay 
funeral/burial arrangements.
	3.	 Benefits of autopsy
	
a.	 For families:
	
(1)	 Provides closure regarding diagnosis.
	
(2)	 Identifies possible genetic etiologies for unexplained death.
	
b.	 For providers: clarifies potential diagnostic errors and uncertainties. 
F.  Organ Donation
	
a.	 Most hospitals have a special third-­party team that coordinates organ 
donations.
	
b.	 Inform family members, if they are interested, that this team may be 
visiting soon to explain the process. 
G.  Completing Death Certificates14
	1.	 Locate a copy of a sample death certificate for reference.
	2.	 Cardiopulmonary arrest or respiratory arrest is NOT an acceptable 
primary cause of death.
	3.	 For specific instructions for your state and/or institution, contact the 
Office of Decedent Affairs at your institution.
	4.	 If you are completing a handwritten death certificate:
	
a.	 Use BLACK INK ONLY and complete Physician sections.
	
b.	 DO NOT use abbreviations (e.g., spell out the month: January 31, 
not 1/31).
	
c.	 DO NOT cross out or use correction fluid; you must begin again if 
mistakes are made. 
H.  Interacting with Loved Ones After a Child’s Death
	1.	 It is appropriate to send condolence cards, contact families, or attend 
funerals after a child has died. These are all appropriate physician 
activities that are deeply valued by bereaved families. Families want to 
know that their children are not forgotten.
	2.	 Numerous services are available for families, including: pastoral care, 
social work, bereavement coordinators, community support groups, 
counseling services, and bereavement follow-­up programs.

I.  OVERVIEW
A.  Epidemiology and General Approach
	1.	 Prevalence: 15% to 20% of children in primary care practices require 
psychiatric care.1
	2.	 Surveillance and Screening:
	
a.	 Surveillance for mental health issues should occur at all routine well-­
child visits from early childhood through adolescence.
	
b.	 The Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC) is a general mental health 
checklist that screens for a broad array of disorders (Table 24.1).
	3.	 See the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edi-
tion (DSM-­5), for full list of psychiatric diagnoses.2
	4.	 Pharmacotherapy for many disorders may be managed or monitored by 
the pediatrician. See Riddle et al., “Pediatric Psychopharmacology for 
Primary Care.”3 
B.  Mental Status Exam
	1.	 General appearance: dress, self-­care, demeanor, attitude, behavior
	2.	 Motor activity: activity level (restless, fidgety, stereotyped or ritualized 
movements)
	3.	 Speech and language: fluency, comprehension, rate, rhythm, volume, 
expressive and receptive skills
	4.	 Mood and affect: stated and observed
	5.	 Thought form/content
	
a.	 What patient is thinking about
	
b.	 Goal-­directed nature of thoughts, coherence, organization, delusional 
content
	6.	 Abnormal perceptual phenomena: illusions, hallucinations
	7.	 Insight, judgment, cognition 
II.  POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION
A.  Epidemiology4:  
Prevalence in most studies is between 10% and 15%
B. Screening:
	1.	 Universal screening is recommended for all postpartum women.
	2.	 A history of depression doubles the risk of postpartum depression and 
should prompt careful assessment for postpartum symptoms.5

576    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
C.  Diagnosis:
	1.	 Depression occurring in the 12-­month period after birth.
	2.	 Maternal depression is important to identify and treat, given the sub-
stantial impact on the health of the developing infant. Impaired maternal 
attachment may compromise the social, cognitive, and behavioral devel-
opment of the infant.4
	3.	 The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale is a 10-­item questionnaire 
which can be completed in 5 minutes or less.6 
D.  Treatment:
	1.	 Referral to mother’s primary care physician or mental health expert is 
preferred.
	2.	 Integrating maternal mental health into pediatrics practice is ideal.6 
III.  COMMON PSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS IN CHILDREN (2 TO 12 
YEARS)
A.  Attention-­Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
	1.	 Epidemiology:
	
a.	 Persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-­impulsivity that 
interferes with functioning or development.
	
b.	 Prevalence continues to rise. This disorder affected 11.0% (6.4 mil-
lion) of children in the United States in 2011, marking an increase 
from 9.5% (5.4 million) of children in 2007.7,8
	
c.	 Most affected children continue to meet the diagnostic crite-
ria for attention-­deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) through 
adolescence.
	2.	 Screening: Evaluate all children aged 4 to 18 years who have aca-
demic and/or behavioral concerns for ADHD and common comorbid 
conditions (depression, anxiety, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct 
disorder).9
	3.	 Diagnosis2:
	
a.	 DSM-­5 diagnostic criteria: inattention, impulsivity/hyperactivity that 
are more frequent and severe than typically observed in children of 
the same developmental age.
	
b.	 Symptoms must persist for 6 months or more, occur before the age 
of 12 years, and should be evident in two or more settings (e.g., 
home and school). 2,10
	
c.	 Subtypes: Combined, predominantly inattentive, or predominantly 
hyperactive/impulsive.
	
d.	 Diagnosis is made using history, observation, and behavioral check-
lists such as the Vanderbilt Assessment Scale (see Table 24.1).
	
e.	 If the medical history is unremarkable, no further laboratory or 
neurologic testing is required. Psychological and neuropsychologi-
cal testing is not required for diagnosis but is recommended if other 
academic or developmental concerns are present.10
 

--- Page 742 ---
Chapter 24  Psychiatry    577
24
	4.	 Treatment:
	
a.	 Pharmacologic treatment works best with behavioral therapy as an 
adjunct.9
	
b.	 Behavioral therapy may be tried alone in preschool-­age children (4 
to 5 years old), but for older children or in preschool-­age children 
where behavioral therapy is ineffective, combination therapy with 
pharmacologic and behavioral interventions is most effective.11
	
c.	 Before starting a stimulant medication, a history should be taken 
to exclude cardiac symptoms, Wolff-­Parkinson-­White syndrome, a 
family history of sudden death, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and 
long-­QT syndrome. Screening electrocardiography is not required if 
there is no personal or family history of cardiac disease.12
	
d.	 See Table 24.2 for recommended pharmacologic treatments. The 
ADHD Medication Guide provides visual information (see Section VI).
	
(1)	 For preschool-­age children (4 to 5 years old), start with behav-
ioral therapy and, if necessary, a methylphenidate stimulant.3,11
	
(2)	 For elementary-­age children (6 or more years old), start with behav-
ioral and stimulant therapy (methylphenidate or amphetamine).3,11
	
e.	 Titrate medications to maximal symptom control with minimal side 
effects.
	
f.	 Common side effects of stimulants to monitor include appetite 
suppression, abdominal pain, headaches, palpitations, and sleep 
disturbance.9
	
g.	 If the first stimulant is ineffective, consider an alternative class of 
stimulant. Second-­line options as alternative therapy or as an aug-
menting agent to stimulant therapy include guanfacine, clonidine, 
and atomoxetine.3,11
	
h.	 If multiple medication trials prove ineffective, consultation with a 
pediatric psychiatrist is suggested. 
B.  Anxiety Disorders
	1.	 Epidemiology:
	
a.	 A group of disorders characterized by excessive fear, anxiety, and 
related behavioral disturbances.
	
b.	 An estimated 4.7% of all children 3 to 17 years of age are affected, 
with onset most often before the age of 25 and increased prevalence 
(15% to 20%) among adolescents 13 to 17 years of age.13-­15
	2.	 Clinical Presentation:
	
a.	 May present with fear or worry and without recognizing that their fear 
or anxiety is unreasonable.
	
b.	 Commonly have somatic complaints of headache and abdominal 
pain. Patients with many primary care visits for such complaints may 
benefit from formal anxiety screening.
	
c.	 Fear/anxiety may affect school performance or manifest as school 
avoidance.
	
d.	 Crying, irritability, angry outbursts, and disruptive behavior are 
expressions of fear and an effort to avoid anxiety-­provoking stimuli.

578    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	3.	 Screening: Multiple tools, such as the Self-­Report for Childhood Anxiety 
Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) (Table 24.1), are available.
	4.	 Diagnosis:
	
a.	 DSM-­5 diagnostic criteria vary based on the specific disorder2: (1) 
generalized anxiety disorder, (2) separation anxiety disorder, (3) 
social anxiety disorder, (4) selective mutism, (5) specific phobia, (6) 
panic disorder, (7) agoraphobia
	
b.	 Differential diagnosis: obsessive-­compulsive disorder, posttraumatic 
stress disorder.
	5.	 Treatment: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with or without pharma-
cotherapy (see Table 24.2) based on the disorder and its severity.16

C.  Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD)17
	1.	 Epidemiology:
	
a.	 Pattern of angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior, or 
vindictiveness.
	
b.	 Prevalence estimated at approximately 3%. Increased prevalence in 
boys as compared with girls in the preteen years but not in the teens.
	
c.	 Age of onset approximately 6 years of age, frequently comorbid with 
ADHD.
	2.	 Screening: Many screening tools are available, including the Vanderbilt 
Assessment Scale (see Table 24.1).18
	3.	 Diagnosis2:
	
a.	 DSM-­5 diagnostic criteria: angry/irritable mood with argumentative/
defiant behavior and vindictiveness for 6 or more months.
	
b.	 Behavior must be present with at least one nonsibling.
	4.	 Treatment:
	
a.	 No evidence for pharmacologic intervention as first-­line therapy for ODD.
	
b.	 Combination of CBT and parent management training may be most 
effective as first-­line intervention.17 
IV.  COMMON PSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS IN ADOLESCENTS
A.  Depressive Disorders
	1.	 Epidemiology:
	
a.	 A group of disorders characterized by mood changes as well as 
somatic and cognitive symptoms that disrupt functioning.
	
b.	 Prevalence of major depressive disorder: 2% of children, 4% to 8% 
of adolescents.15
	
c.	 Subclinical symptoms: 5% to 10% of children.
	
d.	 Common comorbid conditions: anxiety disorders, disruptive behavior 
disorders, ADHD, substance use.
	2.	 Screening:
	
a.	 Routine screening is recommended for patients 11 years of age or 
older.
	
b.	 Multiple screening tools are available (see Table 24.1). The Patient 
Health Questionnaire (PHQ-­2) is a brief but effective tool for use in 
adolescents.19
	
c.	 All patients with suspected depressive symptoms should be screened 
for suicidal ideation and referred for emergency evaluation if serious 
thoughts and/or action plans are endorsed (see Section V.A).
	3.	 Diagnosis:
	
a.	 DSM-­5 Major Depressive Disorder diagnostic criteria:
	
(1)	 Five or more of the following symptoms for 2 or more weeks: 
Must include either depressed mood/irritability OR anhedonia; 
changes in appetite/weight, sleep, or activity; fatigue or loss of 
energy; guilt/worthlessness; decreased concentration; suicidality.
	
(2)	 Symptoms cause significant impairment in functioning.
 

--- Page 745 ---
580    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	
(3)	 Symptoms not due to substance use or a medical condition.
	
(4)	 No history of manic episodes.20
	
b.	 Other depressive disorders are defined by their own diagnostic crite-
ria2: (1) disruptive mood dysregulation disorder; (2) persistent depres-
sive disorder (dysthymia); (3) premenstrual dysphoric disorder.
	
c.	 Differential diagnosis: bipolar disorder, adjustment disorder.
	4.	 Treatment:

the primary care setting. Referral to subspecialist may be required 
depending on severity or in the case of treatment failure (Fig. 24.1).
	
b.	 Antidepressant medications (see Table 24.2) and CBT combined are 
the most effective treatments, followed by medication alone and then 
CBT alone.21

c.	 SSRIs have a black box warning from the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) concerning a possible increase in suicidal 
thoughts or behaviors after initiation of medication.
	
(1)	 The basis of this warning was a large meta-­analysis that found no 
increase in completed suicides but a small increase in suicidal 
ideation.22
	
(2)	 Multiple professional mental health groups support the continued 
use of SSRIs in treating depression in children and adolescents 
because the benefits appear to outweigh potential risks.20,23,24
	
d.	 Refer to the Physicians Med Guide prepared by the American 
Psychological Association (APA) and American Academy of Child 
and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) for guidelines regarding medica-
tion use for depression in adolescents (see Section VI).25

a.	 Lifetime diagnosis of alcohol abuse: 0.4% to 9%; alcohol depen-
dence: 0.6% to 4.3%.26
	
b.	 Lifetime diagnosis of drug abuse or dependence: 3.3% to 9.8%.26
	
c.	 Common comorbid conditions: disruptive behavior disorders, mood 
disorders, anxiety disorders.
	2.	 Clinical Presentation:
	
a.	 Acute change in mood, behavior, and cognition.

c.	 Evaluate age of onset of use; progression of use for specific substances; 
circumstances, frequency, and variability of use; types of agents used.
	
d.	 Consider urine/serum toxicology evaluation if there is concern for 
substance use and patient consents to testing.
	4.	 Treatment:
	
a.	 Determine goals and readiness for change; promote behavioral 
change through motivational interviewing.27
	
b.	 Families should be involved in treatment.
	
c.	 Medications can be used to manage withdrawal symptoms and/or 
cravings.

weight gain (e.g., diuretic or laxative use, exercise) or purging 
(self-­induced vomiting)
	
(3)	 Self-­evaluation excessively influenced by body shape or 
weight5
	3.	 Treatment:
	
a.	 Aimed at nutritional rehabilitation and therapy (family-­based or as 
a component of day treatment programs). Hospitalization may be 
needed in cases of medical instability. See Chapter 21 for manage-
ment of refeeding syndrome.
	
b.	 SSRIs indicated in the treatment of bulimia nervosa (see Table 24.2). 
No medications have been approved for use in anorexia nervosa.28 
V.  PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCIES
A.  Suicide
	1.	 Epidemiology29: Suicide is the second leading cause of death in children 
and adolescents.
	2.	 Screening:
	
a.	 Primary care setting: risk factor screening30 (Fig. 24.2).
	
b.	 Emergency department setting: the Ask Suicide-­Screening Questions 
(ASQ) (Box 24.1) is validated for identifying pediatric patients at risk 
for suicide.
	3.	 Formal suicide assessment (see Fig. 24.2)
	
a.	 Any positive reply to a screening question warrants formal evaluation 
by a psychiatrist or other mental health professional.
	
b.	 Goal is to determine disposition (inpatient versus outpatient) and 
develop a safety plan with caregivers.

B.  Agitation31,32
	1.	 Definition:
	
a.	 Agitation can be defined as disruptive behavior occurring during 
periods of emotional distress.
	
b.	 Manifestations include
	
(1)	 Excessive motor activity: pacing, fidgeting
	
(2)	 Verbal aggression: yelling, shouting, rapid uninterruptable 
speech, threats
	
(3)	 Physical aggression: hitting, throwing things
	
c.	 Agitation frequently occurs as a manifestation of psychiatric illness, 
but it can also present in behaviorally disordered youth or as a result 
of organic neurologic disease.
	
d.	 Agitation is a multifactorial symptom. Risk factors for agitation 
include history of aggression, history of physical abuse, past psy-
chiatric hospitalizations, traumatic brain injury, autism spectrum 
disorder, delirium, and substance use.
	2.	 Management (Fig. 24.3):
Determine the etiology of agitation:
	
a.	 Review vital signs, presenting history, past diagnoses, past episodes 
of agitation.
	
b.	 Attempt to rule out underlying medical cause (e.g., ingestion, trau-
matic brain injury).
	3.	 Treatment
	
a.	 Nonpharmacologic
	
(1)	 Low-­stimulation environment (e.g., dim lights, move child away 
from busy areas, avoid unnecessary interventions).
	
(2)	 Communicate in a calm, neutral, empathetic tone at eye level 
using simple language.
	
(3)	 Utilize distraction techniques and Child Life services if available.
	
b.	 Pharmacologic: therapy choice should target the etiology of agitation 
(see Fig. 24.3).
	
c.	 Restraints and seclusion: reserved for cases where both nonphar-
macologic and pharmacologic interventions fail. Regulations and 
requirements for use vary by state.
	
(1)	 Close monitoring required.
	
(2)	 Frequent reassessment of necessity of restraints.

I.  EVALUATION OF PULMONARY GAS EXCHANGE
A.  Pulse Oximetry1-­3
	1.	 Noninvasive and indirect measurement of arterial O2 saturation (SaO2) 
estimated by light absorption characteristics of oxygenated and deoxy-
genated hemoglobin in peripheral blood.
	2.	 Limitations:
	
a.	 Measures oxygen saturation, not O2 delivery to tissues.
	
b.	 Insensitive to hyperoxia. See Fig. EC 25.A for oxyhemoglobin dis-
sociation curve.
	
c.	 Artificially increased by carboxyhemoglobin levels >1% to 2%.
	
d.	 Artificially decreased by intravenous dyes, opaque nail polish, and 
methemoglobin levels >1%.
	
e.	 Unreliable when pulse signal is poor due to hypothermia, hypovole-
mia, shock, edema, and movement artifact. 
B.  Capnography4,5
	1.	 Measures CO2 concentration of expired gas by infrared or mass 
spectroscopy.
	2.	 End-­tidal CO2 (ETCO2) correlates with PaCO2 (usually within 5 mmHg in 
healthy subjects).
	3.	 Used to evaluate proper placement of an endotracheal tube, to monitor 
ventilation in mechanically ventilated patients, to assess effectiveness of 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and during polysomnography. 
C.  Blood Gases6-­8
	1.	 Arterial blood gas (ABG): Most accurate way to assess oxygenation 
(PaO2), ventilation (PaCO2), and acid-­base status (pH and HCO3−). See 
Chapter 28 for normal mean values.
	2.	 Venous blood gas (VBG): PvCO2 averages 6 to 8 mmHg higher than 
PaCO2; venous pH is slightly lower than arterial pH.
	3.	 Capillary blood gas (CBG): Correlation with ABG is generally best for pH, 
moderate for PCO2, and worst for PO2. 
D.  Analysis of Acid-­Base Disturbances9-­11
The first step is to determine the primary disturbance (metabolic versus 
respiratory); the second step is to assess for a mixed disorder by calculat-
ing expected compensatory response. See Chapter 11 for details.

II.  PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS (PFT)
Provide objective and reproducible measurements of airway function and 
lung volumes. Used to characterize disease, assess severity, and follow 
response to therapy.
A.  Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR)12,13
Maximal flow rate generated during a forced expiratory maneuver.
	1.	 Used to follow the course of asthma and response to therapy by com-
paring current PEFR with the previous “personal best” and the normal 
predicted value.
	2.	 Limitations: Normal values vary across racial groups, measurement is 
effort dependent, cannot be used reliably in many young children.
	3.	 Normal predicted PEFR values for children are shown in Table 25.1. 
B.  Maximal Inspiratory and Expiratory Pressures14,15
Maximal pressure generated during inhalation and exhalation against a 
fixed obstruction. Used as a measure of respiratory muscle strength.
	1.	 Maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) is in the range of 80 to 120 
cm H2O at all ages. A low MIP may be an indication for ventilatory 
support.
	2.	 Maximum expiratory pressure (MEP) increases with age and is greater 
in males. A low MEP correlates with decreased effectiveness of 
coughing. 
C.  Spirometry (for Children 6 Years of Age or Above)16,17
Plot of airflow versus time during rapid, forceful, complete expiration from 
total lung capacity (TLC) to residual volume (RV) is useful to character-
ize different patterns of airway obstruction (Fig. 25.1). Usually performed 
before and after bronchodilation to assess response to therapy or after 
bronchial challenge to assess airway hyperreactivity.

morning. The inflammation causes increased airway hyperreactivity to a 
variety of stimuli: viral infections, cold air, exercise, emotions, environmen-
tal allergens, and pollutants. 
B.  Clinical Presentation
	1.	 Cough, increased work of breathing (tachypnea, retractions, accessory 
muscle use), wheezing, hypoxia, and hypoventilation. Crackles may also 
be present with asthma exacerbations.
	2.	 No audible wheezing may indicate very poor air movement and severe 
bronchospasm.
	3.	 Radiographic findings: peribronchial thickening, hyperinflation, patchy 
atelectasis. 
C.  Treatment
	1.	 See Chapter 1 for acute management of status asthmaticus.
	2.	 Initial classification and initiation of treatment for ages 0 to 4, 5 to 11, 
and 12 years and above (Figs. 25.3–25.5).
	3.	 Stepwise approach to continued management for ages 0 to 4, 5 to 11, 
and 12 years and above (Figs. 25.6–25.8)
	4.	 Additional management guidelines available from the Global Initiative for 
Asthma.21 
D.  Prevention of Exacerbations
	1.	 Ensure up-­to-­date immunizations, including influenza.
	2.	 Create an asthma action plan.
	3.	 Identify and minimize asthma triggers and environmental exposures.
	4.	 Assess symptom control, inhaler technique, and medication adherence 
with regular clinical evaluations.
	5.	 Consider specialist referral for formal PFTs, monitoring, and allergy testing.
	6.	 See Table EC 25.A for dosing guidelines for inhaled corticosteroids. 
IV.  BRONCHIOLITIS19-­23
A.  Definition
	1.	 Lower respiratory tract infection common in infants and children aged 2 
years and younger.
	2.	 Characterized by acute inflammation, edema, and necrosis of 
airway epithelium, leading to increased mucus production and 
bronchospasm.
	3.	 Most commonly caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), but can 
also be seen with other viruses including parainfluenza virus, adenovi-
rus, mycoplasma, and human metapneumovirus. 
B.  Clinical Presentation
	1.	 Rhinitis and cough, which may progress to tachypnea, wheezing, rales, 
use of accessory muscles, and/or nasal flaring. Transient apnea may 
also be seen.
	2.	 Radiographic findings: hyperinflation and atelectasis.
	3.	 Radiographs and viral testing should NOT be routinely obtained.

Assessing severity and initiating therapy in children who are not currently taking long-term
control medication
CLASSIFYING ASTHMA SEVERITY AND INITIATING
TREATMENT IN CHILDREN 0–4 YEARS OF AGE
Key: EIB, exercise-induced bronchospasm
Notes
• The stepwise approach is meant to assist, not replace, the clinical decision making required to
  meet individual patient needs.
• Level of severity is determined by both impairment and risk. Assess impairment domain by
  patient’s/caregiver’s recall of previous 2–4 weeks. Symptom assessment for longer periods
  should reflect a global assessment such as inquiring whether the patient’s asthma is better or
  worse since the last visit. Assign severity to the most severe category in which any feature
  occurs.
• At present, there are inadequate data to correspond frequencies of exacerbations with
  different levels of asthma severity. For treatment purposes, patients who had ≥2 exacerbations
  requiring oral systemic corticosteroids in the past 6 months, or ≥4 wheezing episodes in the
  past year, and who have risk factors for persistent asthma may be considered the same as
  patients who have persistent asthma, even in the absence of impairment levels consistent
  with persistent asthma.

• At present, there are inadequate data to correspond frequencies of exacerbations 
  with different levels of asthma severity. In general, more frequent and intense 
  exacerbations (e.g., requiring urgent, unscheduled care, hospitalization, or ICU 
  admission) indicate greater underlying disease severity. For treatment purposes, 
  patients who had ≥2 exacerbations requiring oral systemic corticosteroids in the past 
  year may be considered the same as patients who have persistent asthma, even in

• With viral respiratory infection: SABA Q4–6 hr up to 24 hr (longer 
  with physician consult). Consider short course of oral systemic 
  corticosteroids if exacerbation is severe or patient has history of previous 
  severe exacerbations.
• Caution: Frequent use of SABA may indicate the need to step up

Notes:
• The stepwise approach is meant to assist, not replace, the clinical decision making required
  to meet individual patient needs.
• If alternative treatment is used and response is inadequate, discontinue it and use the
  preferred treatment before stepping up.
• If clear benefit is not observed within 4–6 weeks and patient/family medication technique and
  adherence are satisfactory, consider adjusting therapy or alternative diagnosis.
• Studies on children 0–4 years of age are limited. Step 2 preferred therapy is based on
  Evidence A. All other recommendations are based on expert opinion and extrapolation from
  studies in older children.

  course of oral systemic corticosteroids may be needed.
• Caution: Increasing use of SABA or use >2 days a week for symptom relief

Key: Alphabetical order is used when more than one treatment option is listed within 
either preferred or alternative therapy. ICS, inhaled corticosteroid; LABA, long-acting inhaled
b2-agonist; LTRA, leukotriene receptor antagonist; PRN, as needed; SABA, short-acting inhaled 
b2-agonist
Notes:
• The stepwise approach is meant to assist, not replace, the clinical decision making required
  to meet individual patient needs.
• If alternative treatment is used and response is inadequate, discontinue it and use the
  preferred treatment before stepping up.
• Step 1 and step 2 medications are based on Evidence A. Step 3 ICS + adjunctive therapy
  and ICS are based on Evidence B for efficacy of each treatment and extrapolation from
  comparator trials in older children and adults—comparator trials are not available for this
  age group; steps 4–6 are based on expert opinion and extrapolation from studies in older
  children and adults.  
• Immunotherapy for steps 2–4 is based on Evidence B for house dust mites, animal danders,
  and pollens; evidence is weak or lacking for molds and cockroaches. Evidence is strongest
  for immunotherapy with single allergens. The role of allergy in asthma is greater in children
  than in adults. Clinicians who administer immunotherapy should be prepared and equipped
  to identify and treat anaphylaxis that may occur.
• Theophylline is a less desirable alternative due to the need to monitor serum concentration
  levels.

• If alternative treatment is used and response is inadequate, discontinue it and use the preferred 
  treatment before stepping up.
• Zileuton is a less-desirable alternative as adjunctive therapy due to limited studies and the need to 
  monitor liver function. Theophylline requires monitoring of serum concentration levels.
• In step 6, before oral systemic corticosteroids are introduced, a trial of high-dose ICS + LABA + either 
  LTRA, theophylline, or zileuton may be considered, although this approach has not been studied in 
  clinical trials.
• Step 1, 2, and 3 preferred therapies are based on Evidence A; step 3 alternative therapy is based on

  is based on Evidence B, and alternative therapy is based on Evidence B for LTRA and theophylline and
  Evidence D for zileuton. Step 5 preferred therapy is based on Evidence B. Step 6 preferred therapy is
  based on Expert Panel Report 2 (1997) and Evidence B for omalizumab.
• Immunotherapy for steps 2–4 is based on Evidence B for house dust mites, animal danders, and 
  pollens; evidence is weak or lacking for molds and cockroaches. Evidence is strongest for
  immunotherapy with single allergens. The role of allergy in asthma is greater in children than in adults.
• Clinicians who administer immunotherapy or omalizumab should be prepared and equipped to identify 
  and treat anaphylaxis that may occur.

C.  Treatment
Mainstay is supportive care.
	1.	 Assess risk factors for severe disease, such as age less than 12 weeks, 
a history of prematurity, underlying cardiopulmonary disease, or 
immunodeficiency.
	2.	 Clinicians should NOT administer albuterol, epinephrine, systemic 
corticosteroids, or chest physiotherapy to previously healthy infants and 
children with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis. Antibiotics should be adminis-
tered only for concomitant bacterial infection.
	3.	 Nebulized hypertonic saline may be administered to hospitalized infants 
and children, although evidence of effectiveness is mixed.20-­22
	4.	 Evidence supporting continuous pulse oximetry and supplemental O2 
when SpO2 is greater than 90% is currently lacking.
	5.	 Nasogastric or intravenous fluid is necessary when infant is unable to 
maintain oral hydration.
	6.	 High-­flow nasal cannula supports breathing in infants requiring supple-
mental oxygen and may decrease the rate of escalation of care.23
	7.	 RSV immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab for high-­risk infants (see 
Chapter 16). 
V.  BRONCHOPULMONARY DYSPLASIA (BPD)24-­27
A.  Definition
	1.	 Also known as chronic lung disease of prematurity or chronic lung 
disease of infancy.
	2.	 Chronic pulmonary condition that usually evolves after premature birth, 
characterized by a need for oxygen supplementation >21% for at least 
28 days after birth.
	3.	 Thought to be a result of airway inflammation, damage from hyperoxia, 
hypoxia, or mechanical ventilation; results in interference with normal 
lung alveolar, airway, and vascular development.
	4.	 Earlier gestational age in preterm infants is associated with a higher 
likelihood of BPD development. 
B.  Clinical Presentation
Children with BPD may have persistent respiratory symptoms, airway 
hyperreactivity, and supplemental oxygen requirements, especially during 
intercurrent illness. 
C.  Diagnosis
Severity based on oxygen requirement at time of assessment and charac-
terized as mild if on room air, moderate if requiring <30% oxygen or severe 
if requiring >30% oxygen and/or positive pressure.
	1.	 If gestational age at birth was <32 weeks, assess infant at 36 
weeks’ postmenstrual age or at discharge to home, whichever 
comes first.
	2.	 If gestational age at birth >32 weeks, assess infant at 28 to 56 days 
postnatal age or at discharge to home, whichever comes first. 
 

--- Page 768 ---
598    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
D.  Treatment
	1.	 Children with BPD often require some combination of the following for 
their lung disease:
	
a.	 Bronchodilators
	
b.	 Antiinflammatory agents (corticosteroids)
	
c.	 Supplemental oxygen therapy
	
d.	 Diuretics
	
e.	 Tracheostomy and prolonged mechanical ventilation for severe cases
	
f.	 RSV prophylaxis if indicated (see Chapter 16)
	2.	 Children with BPD need close monitoring for complications, which can 
affect additional organ systems and processes, including pulmonary 
or systemic hypertension, electrolyte abnormalities, nephrocalcinosis 
(from chronic diuretics), neurodevelopmental or growth delay, aspiration 
from dysphagia and/or gastroesophageal reflux (GER), and more severe 
infections with RSV or influenza. 
VI.  CYSTIC FIBROSIS28-­37
A.  Definition
Autosomal recessive disorder in which mutations of the cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene reduce the function 
of a chloride channel that usually resides on the surface of epithelial cells 
in the airways, pancreatic ducts, biliary tree, intestine, vas deferens, and 
sweat glands, resulting in progressive obstructive pulmonary disease and 
pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. 
B.  Clinical Manifestations (Fig. 25.9)
C. Diagnosis
Diagnosing CF is a multistep process (Fig. 25.10); a complete evaluation 
involves the following:
	1.	 Newborn screening (NBS): utilizes blood immunoreactive trypsinogen 
(IRT) level and/or CFTR gene mutation analysis.
	2.	 Quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis (sweat chloride) test: gold 
standard for diagnosis. False-­positive results can be seen in untreated 
adrenal insufficiency, glycogen storage disease type 1, fucosidosis, 
hypothyroidism, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, ectodermal dysplasia, 
malnutrition, mucopolysaccharidosis, and panhypopituitarism.
	3.	 Genetic analysis: over 2000 CFTR mutations have been described; the 
most common is F508del. 
D.  Treatment
Patients with CF should be managed within a CF Foundation accredited 
care center.
	1.	 Pulmonary
	
a.	 Airway clearance therapy to mobilize airway secretions and facilitate 
expectoration. Often manual/mechanical percussion and postural 
drainage is used. Older children may use high-­frequency vest 
therapy, mechanical chest percussors, or oscillatory positive expira-
tory pressure (PEP) handheld devices.

at or above the 50th percentile.
	
(4)	Monitoring for CF-­related diabetes or liver disease.
	
b.	 Infertility
	
(1)	Men have absence of the vas deferens; however, assisted fertiliza-
tion is possible using aspiration of viable sperm from testes.
	
(2)	Women who are healthy have relatively normal fertility.
	
c.	 Decreased life expectancy. Survival continues to improve, and 
median predicted survival age is more than 47 years.37 
VII.  OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA SYNDROME (OSAS)38-­42
A.  Definition
Disorder of breathing during sleep characterized by prolonged partial upper 
airway obstruction and/or intermittent complete obstruction that disrupts 
normal ventilation during sleep and normal sleep patterns. 
B.  Clinical Presentation
	1.	 Habitual snoring sometimes accompanied by snorts, gasps, or intermit-
tent pauses in breathing. Increased respiratory effort during sleep.
	2.	 Disturbed or restless sleep with increased arousals and awakenings.
	3.	 Daytime cognitive and/or behavioral problems. Young children rarely 
present with daytime sleepiness.
	4.	 Long-­term complications: neurocognitive impairment, behavioral problems, 
poor growth, cardiac dysfunction, systemic and pulmonary hypertension.
	5.	 Risk factors: adenotonsillar hypertrophy, obesity, family history of OSAS, 
craniofacial or laryngeal anomalies, prematurity, nasal/pharyngeal 
inflammation, cerebral palsy, and neuromuscular disease. 
C.  Diagnosis
	1.	 All children and adolescents should be routinely screened for snoring.
	2.	 If a child snores on a regular basis and has any of the complaints or 
findings shown in Box 25.1, clinicians should obtain a polysomnogram 
or, if polysomnography is not available, refer the patient to a sleep spe-
cialist or otolaryngologist for more extensive evaluation.
 

--- Page 772 ---
602    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	3.	 Polysomnogrpaphy criteria for OSAS diagnosis (one of the following):
	
a.	 One or more obstructive or mixed apnea or hypopnea events per 
hour (AHI ≥1).
	
b.	 PaCO2 >50 mmHg for >25% of sleep time coupled with snoring, 
paradoxical thoracoabdominal movement, or flattening of nasal 
airway pressure waveform implying flow limitation.
	4.	 No standard severity classification. Commonly used: mild (1< AHI ≤5), 
moderate (5< AHI ≤10), and severe (AHI >10). 
D.  Treatment
	1.	 Weight loss for patients who are overweight or obese.
	2.	 Intranasal corticosteroids may be considered for children with mild 
OSAS.38 Follow-­up is needed to assess symptoms and monitor possible 
adverse effects of long-­term intranasal steroids. Oral leukotriene inhibi-
tor (e.g., montelukast) can also be considered.
	3.	 Adenotonsillectomy is recommended as first-­line treatment of patients 
with OSAS documented with an overnight polysomnogram.42 Patients 
should be reevaluated postoperatively to determine whether further 
treatment is required.
	
a.	 Risk factors for postoperative respiratory complications: age <3 
years, severe OSAS on polysomnography (AHI ≥10, lowest oxygen

saturation <80%, and/or significant hypercapnia), cardiac complica-
tions of OSAS, failure to thrive, obesity, craniofacial anomalies, neuro-
muscular disorders, current respiratory infection.
	
b.	 High-­risk children warrant a more comprehensive evaluation and 
postoperative admission for monitoring.
	4.	 Continuous positive airway pressure is recommended as treat-
ment if adenotonsillectomy is not performed or if OSAS persists 
postoperatively.
	5.	 Craniofacial surgery and tracheostomy are reserved for severe cases in 
children with syndromic craniofacial abnormalities. 
VIII.  INFANT AND CHILD SLEEP43-­46
A.  Sleep Duration
	1.	 Recommended average sleep duration varies by age (Table 25.3).
	2.	 Sleep concerns are common in childhood. Inadequate or poor-­
quality sleep can have negative impacts on health, behavior, and 
learning.
	3.	 See Section XI for a discussion of common childhood sleep disorders. 
B.  Sleep-­Related Infant Death
1.  Definition
	
a.	 Sleep-­related infant death: sudden unexplained infant death occur-
ring during an observed or unobserved sleep period.
	
b.	 Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS): cause assigned to infant 
death that cannot be explained after thorough case investigation. 
2.  Epidemiology
	
a.	 Approximately 40 per 100,000 live births in 2013, more than double 
in African American and Native American populations.
	
b.	 Peak incidence is at 1 to 4 months, with 90% occurring before 6 
months.

3.  Safe Infant Sleep
Evidence-­based safe infant sleep recommendations to reduce the risk of sleep-­
related infant death from the 2016 AAP guidelines include the following46:
	
a.	 Back to sleep during every episode of sleep.
	
b.	 Using a firm sleep surface without soft objects or loose bedding.
	
c.	 Room sharing with the infant on a separate surface, ideally for the 
first year of life, but at least for the first 6 months.
	
d.	 Avoidance of overheating and head covering.
	
e.	 Avoidance of alcohol, illicit drugs, and smoke exposure during preg-
nancy and after birth.
	
f.	 Protective factors that should be recommended: Regular prenatal 
care, breastfeeding, routine immunizations.
	
g.	 Modeling of safe sleep by healthcare providers/staff, day care providers, 
and in advertising. 
IX.  BRIEF RESOLVED UNEXPLAINED EVENT (BRUE)47,48
A.  Definition
Formerly termed an apparent life-­threatening event (ALTE), a BRUE is 
defined as an event involving an infant below 1 year of age when the 
observer reports a sudden, brief (typically 20 to 30 seconds) and now 
resolved episode of at least one of the following:
	1.	 Cyanosis or pallor
	2.	 Absent, decreased, or irregular breathing
	3.	 Marked change in muscle tone (hyper-­ or hypotonia)
	4.	 Altered level of responsiveness 
B.  Differential Diagnosis
The three most common differential diagnoses are GER, seizure, and lower 
respiratory tract infection. If an explanation for the event is identified, then 
it is not a BRUE. 
C.  Management
An algorithm for the diagnosis, risk stratification, and management of 
BRUE patients is provided in Fig. 25.11.

	1.	 Insomnia
	
a.	 Difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or both.
	
b.	 In younger children, the common behavioral insomnias of childhood 
include limit-­setting (bedtime resistance) and sleep-­onset associa-
tion disorder (night wakings). Treatment includes bedtime limits and 
appropriate sleep hygiene.
	
c.	 In older children, psychosocial or primary insomnia is characterized 
by excessive worry about sleep and the consequences of inadequate 
sleep. Managed with behavioral interventions.
	
d.	 Insomnia can be secondary to another sleep or medical disorder. A 
comprehensive evaluation is required. Referral to a sleep specialist 
or behavioral psychologist may be useful.
	2.	 Nighttime fears
	
a.	 Common condition that is part of normal development and stems 
from cognitive development.
	
b.	 Characterized by tearful, fearful behavior at bedtime.
	
c.	 Relieved by sleeping with member of household.
	
d.	 Treatment involves reassurance, teaching coping skills, and use of 
security objects. Consider evaluation for anxiety disorder in older

I.  GENERAL PEDIATRIC PRINCIPLES
A.  Limit Radiation Exposure
	1.	 Children are at increased radiation risk given their greater lifetime expo-
sure, relatively small size, increased radiosensitivity, and longer lives 
during which to manifest side effects.1
	2.	 Use evidence-­based imaging guidelines to guide appropriate imaging 
choice and minimize radiation exposure.1
	3.	 See Table 26.1 for relative radiation by imaging study. 
B.  Use Imaging Judiciously
	1.	 Minimize use of ionizing radiation when possible.
	2.	 Limit imaging to indicated areas to improve resolution and minimize 
radiation exposure.
	3.	 Provide adequate clinical background when ordering imaging studies to 
assist radiologist. 
II.  CHOOSING THE RIGHT STUDY
	1.	 See Table 26.2 for descriptions of imaging modalities.
	2.	 Computed tomography (CT) versus magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): 
CT is often more readily available, can be performed quickly, and does 
not require sedation; however, CT raises safety concerns regarding 
radiation exposure. MRI uses nonionizing radiation and may require 
sedation.1
	3.	 Contrast: Helps distinguish selected body areas from surround-
ing tissue. Oral and rectal contrast is used for bowel opacification. 
Intravenous is used to opacify vascular structures and solid organs. 
III.  HEAD
Head ultrasound (HUS) can be used for infants with open anterior fonta-
nelles. CT is preferred for acute situations (e.g., trauma, hemorrhage) and 
for evaluating bone structure or calcifications. MRI offers better soft-­tissue 
contrast and visualization of brain anatomy and is, therefore, preferred for 
most nontraumatic intracranial pathology. MRI fast sequences (such as 
ultrafast [UF] MRI) uses specialized sequencing to assess ventricular size 
and shunt position without requiring sedation. Does not allow for adequate 
delineation and diagnosis of other brain pathology.1

A.  Head Trauma
	1.	 Preferred imaging: Noncontrast head CT. Use the Pediatric Emergency 
Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) rules to decide whether 
imaging is indicated (see Chapter 2).2,3 
B.  CSF Shunt Malfunction
	1.	 Preferred imaging: Ultrafast brain MRI (UF MRI).
	2.	 Other imaging: CT if UF MRI is not available or contraindicated. Shunt 
series (plain radiographs evaluating shunt tubing) are useful. 
C.  Orbital Cellulitis
	1.	 Preferred imaging: Orbital contrast-­enhanced CT (Fig. EC 26.A).4 
IV.  NECK AND AIRWAY
Conventional radiography (CR) anteroposterior (AP) and lateral neck views 
are preferred initial imaging.5,6
A.  Normal Anatomy
	1.	 Normal anatomy (Figs. 26.1 and 26.2).
	2.	 Reading lateral C-­spine films.
	
a.	 Must visualize skull base, C1 to C7, top of T1.
	
b.	 Assess alignment by evaluating four curvilinear contour lines: anterior 
vertebral, posterior vertebral, spinolaminar, tips of spinous process 
(Fig. 26.3).
	
c.	 Evaluate vertebral bodies for fractures, displacement, subluxation, 
dislocations. Vertebral bodies should be same height and uniformity 
below C2.
	
d.	 Evaluate predental and prevertebral spaces for widening. 
B.  Cervical Spine Trauma
	1.	 Initial imaging: CR, lateral and AP. 
	2.	 Other imaging: MRI if high clinical suspicion of C-­spine injury without CR 
findings.

Normal soft tissue lateral neck radiograph.  The adenoids (A) are seen at the base of 
the skull and are adjacent to the nasopharyngeal airway (N). More distally is the phar-
ynx (P). The epiglottis (solid white arrow) is bounded superiorly by air in the vallecula. 
The aryepiglottic folds are thin, paired structures (dotted white arrow). The normal-­
sized laryngeal ventricle (black arrow) separates the false vocal cords above from the 
true cords below. The trachea (T) starts below the true cords. The retropharyngeal 
soft tissue (asterisks) is less than one-­half the width of the adjacent vertebral body 
above C3/C4 (*) and less than the width of the adjacent vertebral body below C3/C4 
(**). (Modified from Herring, W. Learning Radiology: Recognizing the Basics. 3rd ed.

tures of same density; used to localize lung pathology (Table 
26.3).10
	
(2)	 Spine sign: Vertebral bodies of thoracic spine become less 
opaque (blacker) as moving inferiorly toward diaphragm. 
Soft tissue or fluid density involving posterior lower lobe adds 
density causing spine to become more opaque (whiter) above 
diaphragm.1,10
	
c.	 Patterns of pneumonia 
Certain radiographic patterns are highly suggestive of particular micro-
organisms but impossible to identify with certainty (Table EC 26.A).10 
C.  Neonatal Lung Disease
	1.	 Respiratory distress syndrome (or hyaline membrane disease): 
Hypoinflation, symmetrical hazy reticulogranular opacities, prominent 
air bronchograms, poor definition of pulmonary vessels.6-­8
	2.	 Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN): Interstitial edema, small 
pleural effusions, increased vascular markings, mildly enlarged cardio-
thymic silhouette, hyperinflation.6,7
	3.	 Meconium aspiration syndrome: Bilateral, asymmetric areas of hyper-
inflation and atelectasis; asymmetric perihilar opacities, which can 
be associated with pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, or pleural 
effusions.7,8
	4.	 Neonatal pneumonia: Bilateral, patchy interstitial opacities, 
hyperinflation.7 
D.  Mediastinal Masses
	1.	 Preferred imaging: CR followed by contrast-­enhanced CT.
	2.	 Findings: Middle mediastinal masses silhouetting the heart border and 
aorta.1 
VI.  HEART (SEE CHAPTER 7)
ECHO is the first-­line imaging modality. Cardiac MR (CMR) evaluates 
extracardiac anatomy; gold standard for quantifying ventricular volume, 
mass, and ejection fraction; creates a three-­dimensional reconstructions 
of complex congenital heart disease (CHD) without radiation. Cardiac CT 
is alternative if CMR is contraindicated (see Fig. 26.4 for normal cardiac 
findings on CXR).1,8

VII.  ABDOMEN
CR used for initial workup; two-­view studies (supine and upright) are often 
preferred. Decubitus and cross-­table lateral views can help localize free air, 
foreign bodies, and enteric tubes; may replace upright view if needed.7 US is 
the initial modality for abdominal masses, ascites, appendicitis, abscesses, 
and biliary pathology.1 CT is preferred for trauma and further evaluation.1 MRI 
is becoming more frequently utilized, including magnetic resonance cholan-
giopancreatography (MRCP) for pancreatitis, biliary pathology, and trauma; 
and magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) in known or suspected inflam-
matory bowel disease to assess disease activity, extent of bowel involvement, 
and extraintestinal complications.1 Cross-­sectional imaging (US, CT, or MR) 
is preferred for suspected inflammation, infection, tumors, and lymphade-
nopathy. Upper GI (UGI) series can assess upper GI obstruction in neonates, 
malrotation, anatomic malformations, and motility problems.7
A.  Normal Abdominal X-­ray and Bowel Gas Pattern
	1.	 Neonatal bowel gas pattern: Gas should be present in stomach by 15 
minutes of life, in proximal small bowel by 30 to 60 minutes, in most of 
small intestine by 6 hours, and in colon by 12 to 24 hours (Fig. 26.5).6,11 
Bowel loop diameter and bowel wall thickness should be uniform.5
	2.	 After infancy, pockets of gas should be visualized in small bowel, colon, 
and rectum.
	3.	 Small bowel seen if contains gas, located centrally, has valvulae 
(extends across bowel), normal diameter smaller than 3 cm.
	4.	 Large bowel contains gas and stool, located peripherally, has haustra 
(extends partially across bowel), normal diameter smaller than 5 cm. 
B.  Pneumoperitoneum (Free Intraperitoneal Air)
	1.	 Preferred imaging: CR including upright imaging (cross-­table or decubi-
tus lateral if patient unable to stand or sit). 
	2.	 Other imaging: CT confirms diagnosis, detects small amounts of air not 
seen on CR.10
	3.	 Findings: Air under diaphragm
	
a.	 Continuous diaphragm sign: Air under entire diaphragm, including 
underneath heart silhouette

616    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
	
b.	 Falciform ligament sign: Ability to visualize normally invisible falci-
form ligament as free air surrounds ligament (Fig. EC 26.G)
	
c.	 Football sign: Oval appearance of abdominal cavity outlined by gas 
with visualization of falciform ligament, seen in massive pneumoperi-
toneum (see Fig. EC 26.G)10 
C.  Neonatal Enterocolitis (see Chapter 18)
	1.	 Initial imaging: CR, include cross-­table lateral or left decubitus views to 
evaluate for free air.7
	2.	 Other imaging: Intestinal US if high clinical suspicion for NEC and CR non-
specific or inconclusive, as can depict changes in intra-­abdominal fluid, 
bowel wall thickness, and bowel wall perfusion before findings on CR.12
	3.	 CR findings: Nonspecific signs: Diffuse gaseous distention (most 
common), loss of normal symmetrical distribution of gas, persistence 
of single dilated bowel loop (fixed loop sign). Pathognomonic signs: 
Pneumatosis intestinalis (intramural gas with “bubbly” appearance 
commonly in distal small bowel and colon), portal venous gas (branch-
ing lucencies seen projecting over liver) (Fig. 26.6).7 
D.  Neonatal Intestinal Obstruction
	1.	 Difficult to distinguish small from large bowel in neonates.5
	2.	 Initial imaging: CR to decipher high obstruction (stomach to proximal 
ileum) from low obstruction (distal ileum to colon).
	3.	 Further imaging: UGI series or esophagram (obstruction proximal to 
ligament of Treitz), UGI series with small bowel follow-through (liga-
ment of Treitz to ileocecal junction), contrast enema (distal to ileocecal 
junction).5,7,9
	4.	 High intestinal obstruction
	
a.	 CR findings: Few dilated loops of bowel.
	
b.	 Duodenal atresia: Double bubble on CR (Fig. EC 26.H), reflecting air 
in dilated stomach and proximal duodenum with absence of air dis-
tally. If partial obstruction, UGI series further differentiates duodenal 
stenosis or web from midgut volvulus.7
	
c.	 Malrotation: Malpositioned duodenojejunal junction/ligament of Treitz 
(normally at level of duodenal bulb and to left of spine). UGI series is 
the gold standard. US can be used for rapid screening.5,7
	5.	 Low intestinal obstruction
	
a.	 CR findings: Multiple dilated loops of bowel; assess further with 
contrast enema.
	
b.	 Ileal atresia: Contrast enema shows opacification of diffusely small 
caliber large bowel (microcolon). Contrast refluxes into distal ileum, 
but unable to reflux further. Bowel proximal to distal ileum is air filled 
and dilated.
	
c.	 Hirschsprung disease: Contrast enema shows “transition zone” 
between nondilated aganglionic distal colon and normal, relatively 
distended, proximal colon.7

E.  Pyloric Stenosis
	1.	 Preferred imaging: Upper abdominal US.
	2.	 Findings: Abnormal thickening of pyloric muscle (≥3 mm) and elonga-
tion of pyloric channel (>15 to 17 mm).10

G.  Ileus
	1.	 Preferred imaging: CR.
	2.	 Findings: Small and large bowel distention.1,10 
H.  Mechanical Bowel Obstruction
	1.	 Initial imaging: CR. Supine view for identifying gas pattern. Upright/
erect, cross-­table lateral, or lateral decubitus for identifying free air and 
air-­fluid levels.
	2.	 Other imaging: CT with oral contrast determines obstruction site. CT with 
IV contrast to detect complications such as ischemia.10 Note: CR has 
low sensitivity for identifying bowel obstruction; therefore, CT should be 
obtained if obstruction clinically suspected.
	3.	 Findings: Dilated loops of bowel proximal to obstruction, little to no air in 
rectum.1
	
a.	 Small bowel obstruction: Numerous air-­fluid levels. Distended bowel 
normally more central.
	
b.	 Large bowel obstruction: Few to no air-­fluid levels. Distended bowel 
normally more peripheral. 
I.  Appendicitis
	1.	 Preferred imaging: RLQ US.
	2.	 Other imaging: MRI if US equivocal. CT only if MRI unavailable or 
patient unstable or cannot tolerate MRI.1,7
	3.	 US findings: Fluid-­filled, noncompressible, blind-­ending tubular struc-
ture greater than 6 mm in diameter.1,7 
J.  Esophageal Foreign Bodies
	1.	 Preferred imaging: CR, evaluate entire GI tract (AP/lateral neck, chest, 
abdomen).
	2.	 Other imaging: Esophagram with water-­soluble contrast if suspicion high 
but CR negative.7
	3.	 Findings: Most commonly lodged at thoracic inlet. Only radiopaque 
objects can be visualized on CR. May see mass effect on adjacent 
structures from swelling caused by foreign body.
	
a.	 Coins (most common): Flat object on frontal view with edge visual-
ized on lateral.
	
b.	 Disk batteries: Bilaminar structure, must identify as may cause seri-
ous chemical injury.7 
K.  Abdominal Trauma
	1.	 Preferred imaging: CT with IV contrast.
	2.	 Other imaging: If hemodynamically unstable, rapid bedside US using 
focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) protocol to 
evaluate for free fluid.7 FAST evaluates bilateral upper quadrants, bilat-
eral pericolic gutters, pelvis, and pericardium.1 
L.  Gallbladder Disease
	1.	 Preferred imaging: US. Patients should fast for 6 hours prior to allow for 
gallbladder filling.1
 

--- Page 801 ---
Chapter 26  Radiology    619
26
	2.	 Findings: Posterior acoustic shadowing in cholelithiasis. Nonshadowing 
echogenic foci if stone disease, polyps, other masses. Gallbladder wall 
thickening (>3 mm), positive sonographic Murphy’s sign (localized 
tenderness with transducer palpation over gallbladder), sludge, and 
pericholecystic fluid with cholelithiasis in acute cholecystitis.1 
M.  Pancreatitis
	1.	 Initial imaging: US.
	2.	 Other imaging: CT with IV contrast if lack of clinical improvement or 
equivocal US. MRCP for detecting choledocholithiasis and biliary/pan-
creatic duct anomalies.13
	3.	 US findings: Pancreatic duct dilation, abnormal echogenicity, peripan-
creatic fluid.1,7 
VIII.  GENITOURINARY TRACT
Renal and bladder ultrasound (RBUS): first-­line imaging modality; evaluates 
kidneys, ureters, and bladder; can assess calculi. Fluoroscopic voiding 
cystourethrogram (VCUG), radionuclide cystourethrography (RNC), and 
contrast-­enhanced voiding urosonography (ceVUS) assess for vesicoureteral 
reflux. Nuclear renal scintigraphy (Mag-­3 scan) assesses renal perfusion, 
function, and excretion. Cross-­sectional imaging (CT, MR, MR urography) 
assesses for genitourinary (GU) tract tumors or obstruction. Additionally, 
MR urography can evaluate renal function and unenhanced CT can assess 
collecting system calculi.7
A.  Urinary Tract Infection
See Chapter 19. 
B.  Nephrolithiasis/Urolithiasis
	1.	 Preferred imaging: US
	2.	 Other imaging: Noncontrast CT if US equivocal.1,7
	3.	 US findings: Echogenic, shadowing foci.7
	4.	 CT findings: Radiodense stones, dilated ureteral or collection system, 
asymmetric enlargement of kidney.1 
C.  Testicular Pathology
	1.	 Preferred imaging: Duplex US.1
	2.	 Testicular torsion findings: Absence of blood flow to center of testicle.1
	3.	 Acute epididymitis findings: Enlarged epididymis, scrotal thickening, 
reactive hydrocele, increased blood flow.1 
D.  Ovarian Pathology
	1.	 Preferred imaging: Pelvic US.
	2.	 Ovarian cyst findings: Well-­circumscribed anechoic structures within 
pelvis measuring more than 3 cm in diameter. Hyperechoic material 
within cyst indicates possible hemorrhage.9
	3.	 Ovarian torsion findings: Variable appearance, usually unilateral enlarged 
solid ovary with multiple peripheral follicles.9 Absence or presence of 
flow on duplex not a reliable indicator of torsion.7

620    Part II  Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
E.  Congenital Hydronephrosis
	1.	 Normally first detected on fetal US, defined as AP renal pelvis diameter 
greater than 4 mm in second trimester and greater than 7 mm in third 
trimester.
	2.	 Preferred imaging: US to confirm postnatally, as can resolve spontane-
ously. Do not perform until at least 48 hours after delivery given risk of 
false negatives or underestimation of severity.1
	3.	 Findings: Moderate-­to-­severe hydronephrosis (>10 mm) with 
clinical suspicion or family history warrants further evaluation 
with VCUG. Repeat US at age 4 to 6 weeks to confirm absence of 
hydronephrosis.1,14 
IX.  MUSCULOSKELETAL
CR is the primary imaging modality; used in trauma, infection, and suspected 
bone lesions.7 MRI provides superior contrast resolution of soft tissue and bone 
marrow; preferred for patellar dislocation and avulsion fractures. Use IV contrast 
to delineate inflammation, ischemia, revascularization, and tumors.1 US used for 
superficial soft-­tissue masses and suspected joint effusions.
A.  Fractures and Trauma
	1.	 Preferred imaging: CR. For long bones, obtain at least two projections. For 
joints, obtain at least three projections and evaluate proximal and distal 
joint. Fractures may not be seen on initial XR; consider repeat XRs in 7 to 
10 days as may visualize periosteal reactions around healing fracture.1,7
	2.	 Findings: Abrupt disruption of the cortex or acute angulation of smooth 
contour of normal bone.10 Indirect signs: soft-­tissue swelling, joint effu-
sion, periosteal reaction (if subacute or healing).
	3.	 Describing fractures.10
	
a.	 Location: Laterality, location on bone, relation to joint (intra-­articular, 
extra-­articular).
	
b.	 Type: Complete (through whole cortex), incomplete (retains some 
continuity [e.g., plastic, bowing, torus, greenstick]), Salter-­Harris 
(involves growth plate) (Table 26.4)
	
c.	 Number of fragments: Simple (two fragments) or comminuted (>2).
	
d.	 Direction of fracture lines: Transverse (perpendicular to long axis), 
oblique/diagonal (diagonal in orientation relative to long axis), spiral 
(corkscrew, twisting).
	
e.	 Relationship (distal fracture fragment to proximal fragment): 
Displacement (amount distal fragment is offset in nonlongitudinal 
axis), angulation (angle between fragments), apposition (amount of 
contact between fragments), shortening (amount of overlap between 
fragments, change in bone length), distraction (distance fragments 
are separated in longitudinal axis), rotation (orientation of joint at one 
end of fracture relative to joint at other end).
	
f.	 Open versus closed: Open or compound (communication between 
fracture and outside atmosphere), closed or simple.

26
	4.	 Common pediatric fracture patterns: see Chapter 2.
	5.	 Elbow XRs.
	
a.	 Anterior humeral line: Line drawn tangential to anterior humeral 
cortex should bisect middle third of capitellum. If line more anterior, 
supracondylar fracture should be suspected (Figs. 26.7 and 26.8).10
	
b.	 Radiocapitellar line: Line drawn through the center of radial neck 
should pass through the center of capitellum. If it does not, disloca-
tion should be suspected (see Figs. 26.7 and 26.8).14
	
c.	 Ossification centers: Mnemonic CRITOE commonly used to remember 
sequential order of appearance (Table EC 26.B and Fig. EC 26.I).15
	
d.	 Fat pad: Normal lateral view of flexed elbow shows only anterior fat 
pad (lucency). Elevated anterior fat pad and visible posterior fat pad 
indicates intra-­articular injury and possible radial head fracture (posi-
tive fat-­pad sign) (Fig. 26.9).12
	
e.	 Hourglass sign (‘figure-­of-­eight’): On a true lateral view, an hour-
glass or figure-­of-­eight configuration can be visualized on the distal 
humerus (see Fig. 26.9). 
B.  Osteomyelitis
	1.	 Initial imaging: CR. Findings often lag 7 to 14 days after symptom onset; 
however, may rule out or identify alternative diagnosis.1
	2.	 Preferred imaging: MRI. Findings can be seen as early as 24 to 48 
hours after symptom onset.1,16
	3.	 Findings: Metaphysis of long bones most frequently affected. CR: soft-­
tissue swelling, bony destruction, cortical loss, periosteal reaction.16 
C.  Hip Disorders
	1.	 Developmental dysplasia of the hip
	
a.	 Preferred imaging: US, typically around 6 weeks of age.
	
b.	 Other imaging: Once femoral heads ossify (within 3 to 6 months), CR 
more helpful.7

physis, posterior and inferomedial displacement of femoral head rela-
tive to femoral neck (ice cream falling off cone). Can assess femoral 
head position by drawing line along lateral aspect of the femoral neck 
(Klein’s line), which should intersect the capital femoral epiphysis in

by Cobb method.9 
E.  Bone Lesions
	1.	 Initial imaging: CR, usually diagnostic.
	2.	 Other imaging: MRI defines extent of lesion and staging of malignant 
lesions.1
	3.	 Findings: Benign lesions: demarcated from normal bone, sclerotic mar-
gin around lesion, nonaggressive growth pattern. Pathologic lesions: not 
well demarcated from surrounding normal bone, possible accompany-
ing soft-­tissue mass, periosteal reaction, destructive bone changes. (Fig. 
EC 26.K to Fig. EC 26.O).1 
F.  Skeletal Survey in Suspected Nonaccidental Trauma
	1.	 Imaging: CR at presentation and 2 weeks after presentation. Follow-­up 
surveys may identify initially missed trauma by identifying healing frac-
tures (Fig. EC 26.P).5
	2.	 Evaluate for fractures inconsistent with history or developmental stage.

I.  BRIEF OVERVIEW OF CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF 
RHEUMATOLOGIC DISEASES
A.  Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA)1–­5
	1.	 JIA involves joint swelling or limitation/tenderness upon range of motion 
lasting at least 6 weeks, shown not to be due to another identifiable 
cause, and presenting in children less than 16 years of age.
	2.	 See Table 27.1 for information organized by the divisions of the disease. 
B.  Reactive Arthritis6–­8
	1.	 Affects males more than females (3:1).
	2.	 Sterile inflammatory arthritis as a response to preceding (1 to 4 weeks) 
bacterial or viral infection, particularly of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, 
or genitourinary tracts.
	3.	 Involves acute asymmetrical oligoarticular arthritis of larger joints, often 
the lower extremities.
	4.	 Associated with fever, weight loss, fatigue, tendinitis, bursitis, anterior 
uveitis, conjunctivitis, erythema nodosum, urethritis, and cervicitis. 
C.  Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)1,9–­11
	1.	 SLE typically affects women of childbearing age (occurring nine times 
more often in women than men).
	2.	 People of African descent and Native Americans are affected more 
commonly than Caucasians.
	3.	 See Box 27.1 for clinical criteria for diagnosis. 
D.  Drug-­Induced Systemic Lupus Erythematosus1,6,9
	1.	 Manifests as polyarthritis, myalgia, fever, and serositis, which resolve 
after discontinuation of the inciting drug.
	2.	 Inciting drugs include but are not limited to hydralazine, minocycline, 
procainamide, quinidine, isoniazid, interferon-­alfa, chlorpromazine, 
ethosuximide, carbamazepine, therapy against tumor necrosis factor 
alpha (anti-­TNF α therapy). 
E.  Neonatal Systemic Lupus Erythematosus1,12
	1.	 Neonates born to mothers with active SLE can develop a transient 
lupus-­like syndrome due to transplacental passage of anti-­Ro (anti-­
SS-­A) and anti-­La (anti-­SS-­B) antibodies.
	2.	 Inflammatory features resolve within 6 months as maternal autoantibod-
ies are cleared.

F.  Vasculitis (Table 27.2)1,6,13–­23
G. Sarcoidosis6,14,24–­26
	1.	 Before puberty (very rare): primarily affects Caucasians. During and 
after puberty: predominantly affects African Americans. Males and 
females affected equally.
	2.	 Multisystem, infiltrative, noncaseating granulomatous disease of 
unknown etiology.
	3.	 Lung is the organ most commonly involved; however, it can involve 
nearly all organ systems and have widespread manifestations including 
but not limited to:
	
a.	 Pulmonary: Bilateral hilar adenopathy, restrictive and obstructive 
disease.
	
b.	 CNS: Bilateral or unilateral Bell palsy, seizures, aseptic meningitis.
	
c.	 Cutaneous: Erythema nodosum, plaques, alopecia. 
H.  Scleroderma6,14,27
	1.	 Both juvenile localized scleroderma and juvenile systemic sclerosis 
typically present in mid-­childhood between 6 and 11 years of age with a 
female predominance.
	2.	 Localized (limited) scleroderma: More common than systemic; sclerosis 
limited to skin, muscle, and bone.
	3.	 Diffuse cutaneous systemic scleroderma: Fibrous degenerative changes 
of skin, synovium, digital arteries, and internal organs (gastrointestinal 
tract, heart, lungs, kidneys, and esophagus). 
I.  Sjögren Syndrome1,6,14,28
	1.	 Female-­to-­male ratio 5:1 in children.
	2.	 Widespread lymphocytic infiltration of salivary and lacrimal glands with 
secondary atrophy and obliteration of secretory acini.
	3.	 Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eyes secondary to decreased tear pro-
duction by lacrimal glands).
	4.	 Xerostomia (dry mouth from decreased salivary gland production).
	5.	 May present as parotid gland swelling in children. 
II.  INTERPRETATION OF LABORATORY STUDIES USED IN THE 
DIAGNOSIS AND MONITORING OF RHEUMATOLOGIC DISEASES
Most laboratory studies used to diagnose rheumatic diseases are nonspe-
cific, and results must be interpreted within the context of the full clinical 
picture. Once a diagnosis is established, however, they can be used to 
follow the condition’s clinical course, indicating flares or remission of the 
rheumatic disease.
A.  Acute-­Phase Reactants
Indicate presence of inflammation when elevated. Elevation is nonspecific 
and can result from trauma, infection, rheumatic diseases, or malignancy.1 
Markers include erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-­reactive protein 
(CRP), platelet count, ferritin, haptoglobin, fibrinogen, serum amyloid A, 
and complement.1,6

	1.	 ESR
	
a.	 Measure of the rate of fall of red blood cells in anticoagulated blood 
within a vertical tube; reflects level of rouleaux formation caused by 
acute-­phase reactants.1
	
b.	 Can be falsely lowered in afibrinogenemia, polycythemia, and sickle 
cell disease; these states interfere with rouleaux formation.2
	
c.	 Can be outside normal range for age due to obesity, pregnancy, and 
anemia.29
	
d.	 Serial measurements may help in monitoring disease severity or 
activity in conditions such as SLE and JIA.

	2.	 CRP1,30
	
a.	 Synthesized by the liver, assists in clearance of pathologic bacteria 
and damaged cells via activation of complement-­mediated phagocy-
tosis, and mediates acute inflammation by altering cytokine release.
	
b.	 Increases and decreases rapidly owing to short half-­life (approxi-
mately 18 hours).14
	
c.	 Elevation is nonspecific, indicating only inflammation:
	
(1)	 Most active phases of rheumatic disease result in elevation to 1 to 
10 mg/dL.
	
(2)	 Level greater than 10 mg/dL raises concern for bacterial infection 
or systemic vasculitis.31 
B.  Autoantibodies (Table 27.3)14
The positive predictive value of any autoantibody assay depends on clinical 
context. These studies can prove valuable in confirming clinical suspicion. 
Sensitivities and specificities must be considered with any clinical decision.
	1.	 Antinuclear antibody (ANA)
	
a.	 ANA is a nonspecific test for SLE and other rheumatic disease.1
	
b.	 Positive in approximately 60% to 70% of children with an auto-
immune disease, but can be seen in about 25% of the normal 
population.32,33
	
c.	 If positive, consider ordering individual autoantibodies.6
	
d.	 Can be positive in nonrheumatologic diseases33:
	
(1)	 Malignancy (e.g., acute lymphoblastic leukemia)
	
(2)	 Infections (transiently positive): Mononucleosis, endocarditis, 
hepatitis, malaria
	
e.	 If positive in JIA, there is increased risk of chronic uveitis.29
	2.	 Rheumatoid factor (RF)1,29
	
a.	 M antibodies to the Fc portion of IgG.
	
b.	 Positive in rheumatic and nonrheumatic diseases:
	
(1)	 Rheumatic diseases: Rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, mixed con-
nective tissue disease, scleroderma, and primary Sjögren 
syndrome.
	
(2)	 Infections: Hepatitis B/C, subacute bacterial endocarditis, tuber-
culosis, toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes.
	
c.	 Negative RF does not rule out rheumatic disease.
	
d.	 Prognostic importance in polyarticular JIA: Positive RF suggests 
more aggressive disease.29
	3.	 Anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-­CCP) antibodies
	
a.	 Known to be highly specific for rheumatoid arthritis in adults; found 
primarily in children with polyarticular JIA.29
	
b.	 Anti-­CCP positivity correlates with erosive joint disease in JIA.34,35

C.  Complement1,5
The complement system is composed of a series of plasma proteins and 
cellular receptors that function together to mediate host defense and 
inflammation. Inflammatory processes may increase the synthesis of 
complement proteins or increase their consumption.
	1.	 Total hemolytic complement level (CH50)
	
a.	 Immune complex disease leads to depletion of complement compo-
nents and decreased level of CH50.
	
b.	 Increased in the acute phase response of numerous inflammatory 
states.
	
c.	 Useful screening test for homozygous complement deficiency states 
which have the strongest association with SLE.29
	
d.	 Typically decreased in SLE, acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephri-
tis, subacute bacterial endocarditis.14
	2.	 C3 and C4
	
a.	 Most common complement proteins assayed.
	
b.	 May be increased or decreased in rheumatic diseases, depending on 
disease stage or severity.
	
c.	 Decreased levels of complement proteins:
	
(1)	 Indicator of immune complex formation.
	
(2)	 Complete deficiency of C3 manifests as severe, recurrent infec-
tions with pyogenic organisms.14
	
(3)	 Can occur in active SLE, some vasculitides, and multiple infec-
tions, including gram-­negative sepsis, hepatitis, and pneumococ-
cal infections.
	
(4)	 Decreased levels typically signify more severe SLE, particularly 
with regard to renal disease.
	
(5)	 Persistently low C3 associated with lupus nephritis.
	
(6)	 Severe hepatic failure: Synthesis of complement proteins occurs 
primarily in the liver.
	
(7)	 Congenital complement deficiency, which may predispose to 
development of autoimmune disease.
	
d.	 Increased levels of complement proteins:
	
(1)	 Indicates the active phase of most rheumatic diseases (e.g., JIA, 
dermatomyositis).
	
(2)	 May be seen in multiple infections (e.g., hepatitis, pneumococcal 
pneumonia) as part of the acute-­phase response. 
III.  PRIMARY CARE MANAGEMENT OF RHEUMATOLOGIC 
DISEASES36,38,39
A.  Vaccination
	1.	 Patients on immunosuppressive therapies cannot receive live vaccines, 
but can receive killed/inactivated vaccines.
	2.	 Special considerations should be made for immunocompromised 
patients on biologic or immunosuppressive therapy (see Chapter 16).

B.  Weight Management
	1.	 Obesity and cushingoid fat distribution often result from chronic steroid 
use.
	2.	 In addition to physical health consequences, this may also cause psy-
chologic issues. 
C.  Bone and Skin Health
	1.	 Patients with arthritis or on chronic steroids are at increased risk of 
osteopenia. Ensure adequate calcium and vitamin D intake and weight-­
bearing activities.
	2.	 Patients with SLE and dermatomyositis are particularly vulnerable to 
ultraviolet radiation. They should not be exposed to the sun without 
wearing a broad-­spectrum sunscreen with a high sun-­protection factor 
(SPF) and should not use tanning booths. 
D.  Reproductive Health
	1.	 Disease-­modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biologics, espe-
cially methotrexate, are teratogenic.
	2.	 Teenage patients should receive counseling on the use of contraception. 
E.  Other Aspects of Primary Care Coordination
	1.	 Children with JIA have an increased risk of developing uveitis, which 
is often insidious and asymptomatic. Routine pediatric ophthalmologic 
screening is required.37
	
a.	 The first ophthalmologic exam should occur within 1 month of 
diagnosis.
	
b.	 In active disease, exams should occur every 3 months regardless of 
ANA status.
	
c.	 In inactive disease, frequency varies based on ANA status, disease 
duration, and age of diagnosis.
	2.	 Patients require supportive therapies in the form of physical therapy, 
occupational therapy, and input from rehabilitation specialists, psy-
chologists, and social workers. 
F.  Laboratory Monitoring
See Table 27.4 for information on antiarthritic drug toxicity and 
recommended surveillance.

Determining normal reference ranges of laboratory studies in pediatric 
patients poses some major challenges. Available literature is often limited 
due to small sample sizes of patients used to derive these suggested refer-
ence ranges.
The following values have been compiled from both published literature 
and the Johns Hopkins Hospital Department of Pathology. Reference 
range values vary with the analytic method used. Consult your laboratory 
for its analytic method and range of reference values, and for less com-
monly used parameters that are beyond the scope of this text. Additional 
reference laboratory values may be found in Chapters 10 (Endocrinology), 
Chapter 14 (Hematology), and Chapter 15 (Immunology and Allergy).

aThese reference ranges are similar to data from the SAFETY study,2 which examined 12-­ to 17-­year-­old NHANES partici-
pants and identified the 95th percentile of ALT in boys to be 25.8 U/L and in girls to be 22.1 U/L. In all age groups, similar 
yet slightly higher ALT cutoffs were published in Bussler et al.3 (LIFE Child cohort) and in Zierk et al.4
bAssay with bromocresol green.
cIn all age groups, similar, yet slightly higher AST cutoffs were published in Bussler et al.3 (LIFE Child cohort) and in Zierk 
et al.4
dSimilar data can also be referenced for all age groups in Bussler et al.3 (LIFE Child cohort) and Zierk et al.4
eIt is important to note that these values have not been validated to demonstrate increased risk of atherosclerosis or 
cardiovascular events.
fControversy exists regarding optimal 25-hydroxyvitamin D level. Some experts recommend a level ≥30 ng/mL as 
sufficient.16

Biostatistics and Evidence-­
Based Medicine
Matthew Molloy, MD, MPH
I.  EVIDENCE-­BASED MEDICINE
Evidence-­based medicine refers to the method of integrating individual 
clinical expertise with the best available evidence from the literature. 
The following is a framework on how to formulate a clinical question and 
appraise the evidence1:
A.  Formulate the Clinical Question (PICO Process)
	1.	 P: Describe the patient or problem, deciding whether the evidence 
you seek is regarding therapy, diagnosis, prognosis, etiology, or cost 
effectiveness.
	2.	 I: Describe the intervention under consideration.
	3.	 C: Compare the intervention with an alternative or current standard of care.
	4.	 O: Formulate a specific outcome of interest. 
B.  Search for the Evidence to Answer the Question
	1.	 Define search terms that fit the clinical question.
	2.	 Develop your search strategy using primary search sources such as 
PubMed and secondary sources such as Cochrane.
	3.	 Review your results, and apply methodological filters to target the right 
type of study. 
C.  Critically Appraise the Evidence
	1.	 Therapy
	
a.	 Were patient groups randomized for treatment?
	
b.	 Were groups comparable and treated equally, aside from the allo-
cated treatment?
	
c.	 Were study subjects and investigators blinded?
	
d.	 Were all patients entering the trial accounted for in the groups they 
were randomized to (intention to treat)?
	
e.	 How large was the treatment effect?
	2.	 Diagnosis
	
a.	 Was the test compared with an independent reference standard?
	
b.	 Was the test evaluated in an appropriate spectrum of patients?
	3.	 Prognosis
	
a.	 Were study patients defined early in their course and followed up 
over a sufficient time?
	
b.	 How likely is it that the outcomes occur during a defined time period?
	
c.	 How precise are the estimates of prognosis?
 

--- Page 851 ---
654    Part III  Reference
	4.	 Guidelines for judging causality between a variable and outcome2
	
a.	 Is there a temporal relationship?
	
b.	 What is the strength of association?
	
c.	 Is there a dose-­response relationship?
	
d.	 Were the findings replicated?
	
e.	 Are the findings biologically plausible?
	
f.	 What happens with cessation of exposure?
	
g.	 Is this explanation consistent with other knowledge?
	5.	 Bias: Consider these types of bias that may influence results or distort 
statistical findings2:
	
a.	 Selection bias: Caused by a nonrandom or dissimilar sample 
(between cases/controls or exposed/unexposed) from a population. 
Examples include sampling bias, loss to follow-­up, and exclusion 
bias. Mitigated by randomization and selection of participants who 
are representative of the target population.
	
b.	 Information bias: Caused by flawed collection of information about 
exposures or outcomes. Examples include recall bias, observer bias, 
and lead-­time bias. Mitigated by blinding researchers to subject 
status and standardizing data collection procedures. 
D.  Apply the Evidence to the Clinical Question
If the evidence is valid and important, integrate it with your clinical exper-
tise and decide whether:
	1.	 The patient will benefit from the therapy and be able to tolerate potential 
harms.
	2.	 The test is available, affordable, accurate, and precise. 
II.  BIOSTATISTICS AND EPIDEMIOLOGY
A.  Statistical Tests
The following statistical tests are used to determine whether observed dif-
ferences are statistically significant (Table 29.1).3-­5
	1.	 Parametric tests are used when data follow a particular distribution 
(e.g., a normal distribution—a bell-­shaped distribution where the 
median, mean, and mode are all equal). These tests are generally more 
powerful.
	2.	 Nonparametric tests are used when a particular distribution cannot be 
assumed; they rank data rather than taking absolute differences into 
account.
	3.	 Unpaired tests compare values from independent samples.
	4.	 Paired tests are performed on paired data. For example, where the 
same parameter is measured on each patient before and after an 
intervention.
	5.	 Two-­tailed tests should be used when an intervention could potentially 
lead to either an increase or decrease of the outcome.
	6.	 One-­tailed tests should be used when an intervention can have only one 
plausible effect on the outcome.

B.  Statistical Terminology
	1.	 α (Alpha): Significance level of a statistical test3,6
	
a.	 α: Probability of making a type I error; the probability of rejecting the 
null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true (i.e., a difference is 
seen by chance alone).

b.	 α is typically set at less than 0.05 in medical research, which 
allows interpretation with 95% certainty that a detected associa-
tion is true.
	
c.	 The P value is the probability of obtaining the observed values if 
the null hypothesis is true. For example, if P = 0.01, there is a 1 in 
100 chance of the values being from chance alone. The P value is 
judged against α, the preset level of significance. If P is less than 
the significance level α, the detected association is considered 
significant.
	2.	 β (Beta): Power of a statistical test
	
a.	 β: Probability of making a type II error; the probability of accepting 
the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true (i.e., no 
difference is seen even though there is one).
	
b.	 Power = 1 − β: Probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis 
(i.e., finding a difference when there truly is one).
	
c.	 Power is typically set at a minimum of 0.80, which allows inter-
pretation with 80% certainty that a detected lack of association is 
true.
	3.	 Sample size: The number of subjects required in a study to detect an 
effect with a predetermined power and α.
	4.	 95% confidence interval: Describes the values between which there is 
a 95% chance that the true population value falls. When confidence 
intervals for groups overlap, they have no statistically significant 
difference.
	5.	 Confounder: A variable associated with both the disease and the 
exposure (risk factor), leading to detection of a false relationship 
between the disease and exposure if the confounder is not accounted 
for. Can be controlled for by adjustment, matching, blinding, and 
randomization.
	6.	 Effect modifier (interaction): A variable that modifies the observed effect 
of an exposure on disease. For example, if a new drug is effective in 
female children but not male children, then sex is an effect modifier. 
Can be controlled by stratification.

to estimate posttest probability of a disease based on a given test result. 
Tests that provide the greatest impetus to changing clinical manage-
ment are those with an LR ≥10 (or LR ≤0.1 for negative tests). LR is 
unaffected by disease prevalence.

I.  NOTE TO READER
The author has made every attempt to check dosages and medical content 
for accuracy. Because of the incomplete data on pediatric dosing, many 
drug dosages will be modified after the publication of this text. We recom­
mend that the readers check product information and published literature 
for changes in dosing, especially for newer medicines. The US Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) provides the following pediatric drug information 
data sources:
 • New Pediatric Labeling Information: www.fda.gov/NewPedLabeling
 • Drug Safety Report Updates: www.fda.gov/PedDrugSafety
 • Pediatric Study Characteristics Database: www.fda.gov/PedStudies
Ongoing and completed clinical research study information of pediatric 
medicines in development is located in www.Clinicaltrials.gov.
To prevent prescribing errors, the use of abbreviations has been 
greatly discouraged. The following is a list of abbreviations that The Joint

Injection (Aloprim and generics): 500 mg
Contains ~ 1.45 mEq Na/500 mg drug 
For use in tumor lysis syndrome, see Chapter 22 for additional information. 
Child:
Oral: 10 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ BID–QID; max. dose: 800 mg/24 hr 
Injectable: 200 mg/m2/24 hr IV ÷ Q6–12 hr; max. dose: 600 mg/24 hr 
Adult:
Oral: 200–800 mg/24 hr PO ÷ BID–TID 
Injectable: 200–400 mg/m2/24 hr IV ÷ Q6–12 hr; max. dose: 600 mg/24 hr 
 
Discontinue use at the first appearance of skin rash or other signs of an allergic
 
reaction. Avoid use in individuals with HLA-B*58:01 allele as they are at significant
 
risk for developing severe cutaneous adverse reactions (e.g., Stevens Johnson
Syndrome and TEN). Side effects include rash, neuritis, hepatotoxicity, GI disturbance,
bone marrow suppression, and drowsiness. Adjust dose in renal insufficiency (see
Chapter 31). Must maintain adequate urine output and alkaline urine.
Drug interactions: increases serum theophylline level; may increase the incidence of rash
with ampicillin and amoxicillin; increased risk of toxicity with azathioprine, didanosine and
mercaptopurine; and increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions with ACE inhibitors and
thiazide diuretics. Use with didanosine is contraindicated due to increased risk for
didanosine toxicity. Rhabdomyolysis has been reported with clarithromycin use. IV dosage
form is very alkaline and must be diluted to a minimum concentration of 6 mg/mL and
infused over 30 min.

IV.  EXPLANATION OF PREGNANCY CATEGORIES
A Adequate studies in pregnant women have not demonstrated a risk to the 
fetus in the first trimester of pregnancy, and there is no evidence of risk 
in later trimesters.
B Animal studies have not demonstrated a risk to the fetus, but there are 
no adequate studies in pregnant women; or animal studies have shown 
an adverse effect, but adequate studies in pregnant women have not 
demonstrated a risk to the fetus during the first trimester of pregnancy, 
and there is no evidence of risk in later trimesters.
C Animal studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus, but there are 
no adequate studies in humans; or there are no animal reproduction 
studies and no adequate studies in humans.
D There is evidence of human fetal risk, but the potential benefits from 
the use of the drug in pregnant women may be acceptable despite its 
potential risks.
X Studies in animals or humans demonstrate fetal abnormalities or adverse 
reaction; reports indicate evidence of fetal risk. The risk of use in pregnant 
women clearly outweighs any possible benefit.

Note: The cytochrome P450 enzyme system is composed of different isoenzymes. Each isoenzyme metabolizes a unique group of drugs or substrates. When an inhibitor of a particular isoenzyme is introduced, the serum 
concentration of any drug or substrate metabolized by that particular isoenzyme will increase. When an inducer of a particular isoenzyme is introduced, the serum concentration of drugs or substrates metabolized by 
that particular isoenzyme will decrease.
PPI, Proton pump inhibitor.

ACETAMINOPHEN continued
May be used for the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus when standard NSAID is contraindicated or 
has failed. Most commonly reported dosage is 15 mg/kg dose Q6 hr IV/PO for 3 days (may be given 
up to 7 days or with a repeated 3-­day course).
May decrease the activity of lamotrigine and increase the activity/toxicity of busulfan, warfarin, and 
zidovudine. Barbiturates, phenytoin, rifampin, and anticholinergic agents (e.g., scopolamine) may 
decrease the effect of acetaminophen. Increased risk for hepatotoxicity may occur with barbitu­
rates, carbamazepine, phenytoin, carmustine (with high acetaminophen doses), chronic alcohol 
use, and inducers of CYP 450 2E1 (e.g., isoniazid). Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31).
FOR IV USE: administer dose undiluted over 15 min. Most common side effects with IV use include 
nausea, vomiting, constipation, pruritus, agitation and atelectasis in children; and nausea, 
vomiting, headache and insomnia in adults. Rare risk of serious skin reactions (e.g., SJS, TEN) has 
been reported.

TOPICAL:
Cream (see remarks):
Herpes labialis (≥12 and adult): Apply to affected areas 5 times a day × 4 days
Ointment:
Immunocompromised genital or mucocutaneous HSV: Apply 0.5-­inch ribbon of 5% ointment for 
4-­inch square surface area 6 times a day × 7 days.
OPHTHALMIC:
Herpes simplex keratitis (≥2 yr and adolescent): Apply 1 cm (½-­inch) ribbon onto the lower eyelid of affected 
eye(s) 5 times a day while awake (∼Q3 hr) until corneal ulcer heals then reduce dosage to TID for 7 days.
See most recent edition of the AAP Red Book for further details. Use with caution in patients 
with preexisting neurologic or renal impairment (adjust dose; see Chapter 31) or 
dehydration. Adequate hydration and slow (1 hr) IV administration are essential to prevent 
crystallization in renal tubules. Do not use topical product on the eye or for the prevention of recurrent HSV 
infections. Oral absorption is unpredictable (15%–30%); consider using valacyclovir or famciclovir for 
better absorption. Use ideal body weight for obese patients when calculating dosages. Resistant strains of 
HSV and VZV have been reported in immunocompromised patients (e.g., advanced HIV infection).
Inflammation or phlebitis at the injection site and transient elevations of sCr and BUN are the most 
frequent IV use side effects. Can cause renal impairment and has been associated with headache, ver­
tigo, insomnia, encephalopathy, GI tract irritation, elevated liver function tests, rash, urticaria, arthral­
gia, fever, and adverse hematologic effects. Probenecid decreases acyclovir renal clearance. Acyclovir 
may increase the concentration of tenofovir, and meperidine and its metabolite (normeperidine).
Topical cream acyclovir 5% in combination with hydrocortisone 1% (Xerese) is indicated for herpes 
labialis (≥6 yr and adults) at a dosage of 5 applications per day for 5 days. Use a finger cot or 
rubber glove when applying topical cream or ointment.
Ophthalmic ointment: patient should close his or her eyes for 1–2 min after each application and 
wipe away any excess ointment. Most common side effects include stinging, punctuate keratitis, 
and follicular conjunctivitis. Blepharitis and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported.

palene was as effective and had a more rapid onset of clinical effects with less skin irritation.
ADAPALENE + BENZOYL PEROXIDE: Onset of therapeutic benefits seen in 4–8 wk. Side effects 
reported in placebo-­controlled studies include dry skin, erythema, skin irritation, and contact 
dermatitis. When compared with isotretinoin in a clinical trial for nodulocystic acne, adapalene + 
benzoyl peroxide plus doxycycline was not inferior to isotretinoin and was less effective in reducing 
the number of total lesions (nodules, papules/pustules, and comedones).

 Inhaled doses may be given more frequently than indicated. In such cases, consider cardiac 
monitoring and monitoring of serum potassium (hypokalemia). Systemic effects are dose 
related. Please verify the concentration of the nebulization solution used.
Safety and efficacy for the treatment of symptoms or bronchospasms associated with obstructive 
airway disease have not been demonstrated for children <4 yr of age (either dose studied was not 
optimal in this age or drug is not effective in this age group).
Use of oral dosage form is discouraged due to increased side effects and decreased efficacy com­
pared with inhaled formulations.
Possible side effects include tachycardia, palpitations, tremor, insomnia, nervousness, nausea, and 
headache.
The use of tube spacers or chambers may enhance efficacy of the HFA metered dose inhalers and have 
been proven to be just as effective and sometimes safer than nebulizers. Do not use a spacer device 
with any of the breath activated inhaler dosage forms. Breath-­activated dosage forms require 
patients to generate a minimum inspiratory flow rate of ≥30 L/min for proper dose activation.

administered. Max. daily dose: 2 doses/24 hr and 25 mg/24 hr.
Contraindicated in ischemic/vasospastic coronary artery disease, significant underlying 
cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular syndromes, peripheral vascular disease, 
uncontrolled hypertension, or hemiplegic/basilar migraine. Do not administer with any 
ergotamine-­containing medication ergot-­type medication, any other 5-­HT1 agonist (e.g., triptans), 
methylene blue, or with/within 2 wk of discontinuing an MAO inhibitor or linezolid.
FDA-­labeled indication for adolescents is acute migraine treatment in patients with a history of 
migraine lasting ≥4 hr when left untreated. Efficacy for the treatment of migraine associated 
symptoms of nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were not established for adolescents.
Most common side effects include dizziness, somnolence, headache, paresthesia, nausea, and 
vomiting. Reported serious adverse effects include coronary artery spasm, ischemia (myocardial, 
gastrointestinal, peripheral vascular), cerebral/subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebrovascular 
accident/disease, and vision loss.
Use with caution in renal impairment (CrCl ≤30 mL/min) or hepatic impairment; use initial dose of 
6.25 mg dose with a max. daily dose of 12.5 mg/24 hr.
Almotriptan is a minor substrate for CYP 450 2D6 and 3A4. Use lower initial single dose of 6.25 mg 
with maximum daily dose of 12.5 mg if receiving a potent CYP 450 3A4 inhibitor (e.g., itraconazole, 
ritonavir). Do not use almotriptan in the presence of renal or hepatic impairment and receiving a

6 wk–6 mo: 0.5 mg/kg/hr
6 mo–1 yr: 0.6–0.7 mg/kg/hr
1–9 yr: 1–1.2 mg/kg/hr
9–12 yr and young adult smoker: 0.9 mg/kg/hr
>12 yr healthy nonsmoker: 0.7 mg/kg/hr
The above total daily doses may also be administered IV ÷ Q4–6 hr.
Consider milligrams of theophylline available when dosing aminophylline. For oral route of 
administration, use theophylline.
Monitoring serum levels is essential, especially in infants and young children. Intermittent 
dosing for infants and children 1–5 yr may require Q4 hr dosing regimen due to enhanced 
metabolism/clearance. Side effects: restlessness, GI upset, headache, tachycardia, seizures 
(may occur in absence of other side effects with toxic levels).
Therapeutic level (as theophylline): for asthma, 10–20 mg/L; for neonatal apnea, 6–13 mg/L.
Recommended guidelines for obtaining levels:
IV bolus: 30 min after infusion
IV continuous; 12–24 hr after initiation of infusion
PO liquid, immediate-­release tab (theophylline product):
Peak: 1 hr post dose
Trough: just before dose
PO sustained-­release (theophylline product):
Peak: 4 hr post dose
Trough: just before dose
Ideally, obtain levels after steady state has been achieved (after at least one day of therapy). Liver 
impairment, cardiac failure, and sustained high fever may increase theophylline levels. See 
Theophylline for drug interactions.
Use in breast feeding may cause irritability in infant. It is recommended to avoid breast feeding for 2 hr 
after IV or 4 hr after immediate-­release oral intermittent dose.

Correct hypokalemia, hypocalcemia or hypomagnesemia whenever possible before use as these 
conditions may exaggerate QTc prolongation.
Intravenous continuous infusion concentration for peripheral administration should not exceed 2 mg/
mL and must be diluted with D5W. The intravenous dosage form can leach out plasticizers such as 
DEHP. It is recommended to reduce the potential exposure to plasticizers in pregnant women and 
children at the toddler stages of development and younger by using alternative methods of IV drug 
administration.
Oral administration should be consistent with regards to meals because food increases the rate and

Contraindicated in patients with a history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction 
associated with amoxicillin-­clavulanic acid. Extended-­release tablet dosage form is 
contraindicated in patients with CrCl <30 mL/min.
Clavulanic acid extends the activity of amoxicillin to include β-­lactamase–producing strains of 
Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and some Staphylococcus 
aureus and may increase the risk for diarrhea.
The BID dosing schedule is associated with less diarrhea. For BID dosing, the 875 mg, 1 g tablets, 
the 200 mg, 400 mg chewable tablets or the 200 mg/5mL, 400 mg/5 mL, 600 mg/5 mL suspen­
sions should be used. These BID dosage forms contain phenylalanine and should not be used 
by phenylketonurics. For TID dosing, the 250 mg, 500 mg tablets, the 125 mg 250 mg chewable 
tablets or the 125 mg/5 mL, 250 mg/5 mL suspensions should be used.
Higher doses of 80–90 mg/kg/24 hr (amoxicillin component) have been recommended for resistant 
strains of S. pneumoniae in acute otitis media and pneumonia (use BID formulations containing 
7:1 or 14:1 ratio of amoxicillin to clavulanic acid or Augmentin ES-­600, respectively).

Adult: 1–2 g Q6–8 hr IM/IV
Max. dose: 8 g ampicillin/24 hr
Similar spectrum of antibacterial activity to ampicillin with the added coverage of β-­lactamase 
producing organisms. Total sulbactam dose should not exceed 4 g/24 hr.
Use higher doses with shorter dosing intervals to treat CNS disease and severe infection. Hepatic 
dysfunction, including hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice, has been reported. Monitor hepatic func­
tion in patients with hepatic impairment.
Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31). Similar CSF distribution and side effects to ampicillin.

Benzocaine sensitivity may develop and not intended for prolonged use. Contraindicated if 
tympanic membrane perforated or PE tubes in place. Local reactions (e.g., burning, 
stinging) and hypersensitivity reactions may occur. Risk of benzocaine-­induced 
methemoglobinemia may be increased in infants aged ≤3 mo. 
ARGININE CHLORIDE—INJECTABLE PREPARATION
R-­Gene 10
Metabolic alkalosis agent, urea cycle disorder 
treatment agent, growth hormone diagnostic agent
Injection: 10% (100 mg/mL) arginine hydrochloride, contains 47.5 mEq chloride per 100 mL (300 mL)
Osmolality: 950 mOsmol/L
 Used as a secondary alternative agent for patients that are unresponsive or unable to 
receive sodium chloride and potassium chloride.
Correction of hypochloremia: Arginine chloride dose in milliequivalents (mEq) = 0.2 × patient’s weight (kg) 
× (103 − patient’s serum chloride in mEq/L). Administer ½ to 2⁄3 of the calculated dose and reassess.
Drug administration: Do not exceed an IV infusion rate of 1 g/kg/hr (4.75 mEq/kg/hr). Drug may be 
administered without further dilution but should be diluted to reduce risk of tissue irritation.
Hyperammonemia in metabolic disorders: See Chapter 13
Contraindicated in renal or hepatic failure. Use with extreme caution as overdosages may 
result in hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, cerebral edema, and death. Hypersensitivity 
reactions, including anaphylaxis, and hematuria have been reported.
Arginine hydrochloride is metabolized to nitrogen-­containing products for renal excretion. Excess 
arginine increases the production of nitric oxide (NO) to cause vasodilation/hypotension. Closely 
monitor acid/base status. Hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia, GI disturbances, IV extravasation, 
headache, and flushing may occur.
In addition to its use for chloride supplementation, arginine is used in urea cycle disorder therapy 
(increase arginine levels and prevent breakdown of endogenous proteins) and as a diagnostic 
agent for growth hormone (stimulates pituitary release of growth hormone).

days in duration up to a maximum of 20 mg/24 hr.
 Monitor for clinical worsening of depression and suicidal ideation/behavior after initiation of 
therapy or after dose changes. Avoid use of extended-­release IM injection with CYP 450 
inducers, including carbamazepine, for >14 days. Higher cumulative doses and longer 
treatment duration may increase risk for irreversible tardive dyskinesia.
Weight gain, constipation, GI discomfort, akathisia, dizziness, extrapyramidal symptoms, 
headaches, insomnia, sedation, blurred vision, and fatigue are common. May cause leukopenia, 
neutropenia, agranulocytosis, hiccups, hyperthermia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, hypergly­
cemia, orthostatic hypotension (risk for falls), and prolongation of the QT interval (use considered 
contraindicated with other medications prolonging the QT interval). Rare impulse-­control 
problems such as compulsive or uncontrollable urges to gamble, binge eat, shop, and have sex 
has been reported.
Primarily metabolized by the CYP 450 2D6 and 3A4 enzymes. Dosage reduction for using half of the 
usual dose has been recommended for those who are either known CYP 450 2D6 poor metabolizers; 
or nonpoor CYP 450 2D6 metabolizers taking strong CYP 450 2D6 (e.g., quinidine, fluoxetine, 
paroxetine) or 3A4 (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin) inhibitors. Use of ¼ the usual dose has been 
recommended for known CYP 2D6 poor metabolizers taking either a strong 2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor; or 
nonpoor CYP 450 2D6 metabolizers taking both strong 2D6 AND 3A4 inhibitors.
Consult with a pediatric psychiatrist for use in ADHD, conduct disorder, and PDD-­NOS. Oral doses

Do not use in children <16 yr for treatment of varicella or flulike symptoms (risk for Reye 
syndrome), in combination with other NSAIDs, or in severe renal failure. Use with caution 
in bleeding disorders, renal dysfunction, gastritis, and gout. May cause GI upset, allergic 
reactions, liver toxicity, and decreased platelet aggregation.
Drug interactions: may increase effects of methotrexate, valproic acid, and warfarin which may lead 
to toxicity (protein displacement). Buffered dosage forms may decrease absorption of ketoconazole 
and tetracycline. GI bleeds have been reported with concurrent use of SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine, 
paroxetine, sertraline).
A moderate initial febrile phase dosage of 30–50 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ QID for Kawasaki disease is 
used in Japan and Western Europe because there are no data to suggest this or the higher dosage 
regimen is superior.
Therapeutic levels: antipyretic/analgesic: 30–50 mg/L, antiinflammatory: 150–300 mg/L. Tinnitus 
may occur at levels of 200–400 mg/L. Recommended serum sampling time at steady state: obtain 
trough level just prior to dose following 1–2 days of continuous dosing. Peak levels obtained 2 hr 
(for nonsustained release dosage forms) after a dose may be useful for monitoring toxicity. Adjust 
dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31).
For breast-­feeding considerations:
High-­dose aspirin regimens: use an alternative drug is recommended.
Low-­dose (75–162 mg/24 hr) aspirin regimens: avoid breastfeeding for 1–2 hr after a dose.

up to 100 mg/24 hr.
Adult: 25–100 mg/dose PO once daily; max. dose: 100 mg/24 hr
 Contraindicated in pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock. May cause bradycardia, 
hypotension, second-­ or third-­degree AV block, dizziness, fatigue, lethargy, and headache. 
Use with caution in diabetes and asthma. Wheezing and dyspnea have occurred when daily 
dosage exceeds 100 mg/24 hr. Postmarketing evaluation reports a temporal relationship for 
causing elevated LFTs and/or bilirubin, hallucinations, psoriatic rash, thrombocytopenia, visual 
disturbances, and dry mouth. Avoid abrupt withdrawal of the drug. Does not cross the blood-­brain 
barrier; lower incidence of CNS side effects compared with propranolol. Neonates born to mothers 
receiving atenolol during labor or while breastfeeding may be at risk for hypoglycemia.
Use with disopyramide, amiodarone or digoxin may enhance bradycardic effects. Adjust dose in renal 
impairment (see Chapter 31).

Contraindicated in patients with narrow-­angle glaucoma, pheochromocytoma, and severe 
cardiac disorders. Do not administer with or within 2 wk after discontinuing an MAO 
inhibitor; fatal reactions have been reported. Use with caution in hypertension, 
tachycardia, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases, or with concurrent albuterol 
therapy. Increased risk of suicidal thinking has been reported; closely monitor for clinical 
worsening, agitation, aggressive behavior, irritability, suicidal thinking or behaviors, and 
unusual changes in behavior when initiating (first few months) or at times of dose 
changes (increases or decreases). Atomoxetine is a CYP 450 2D6 substrate; poor 2D6 
metabolizers compared with normal has been reported to have higher rates of adverse 
effects (insomnia, weight loss, constipation, depression, tremor, and excoriation), greater 
improvement of ADHD symptoms with lower final dose requirements. Alopecia and 
hyperhidrosis have been reported.
Doses >1.2 mg/kg/24 hr in patients ≤70 kg have not been shown to be of additional benefit. Reduce 
dose (initial and target doses) by 50% and 75% for patients with moderate (Child-­Pugh Class B) 
and severe (Child-­Pugh Class C) hepatic insufficiency, respectively.
Major side effects include GI discomfort, vomiting, fatigue, anorexia, dizziness, and mood swings.

leucovorin 10 mg PO once daily.
Not recommended in the treatment of severe P. jiroveci (lack of clinical data). Patients with 
GI disorders or severe vomiting and who cannot tolerate oral therapy should consider 
alternative IV therapies. Rash, pruritus, sweating, GI symptoms, LFT elevation, dizziness, 
headache, insomnia, anxiety, cough, and fever are common. Anemia, Stevens-­Johnson syndrome, 
hepatitis, renal/urinary disorders, and pancreatitis have been reported.
Metoclopramide, rifampin, rifabutin, and tetracycline may decrease atovaquone levels. Shake oral sus­
pension well before dispensing all doses. Take all doses with high-­fat foods to maximize absorption.

Increased risk for hepatosplenic T-­cell lymphoma has been reported in adolescents and young 
adults. Toxicity: bone marrow suppression, rash, stomatitis, hepatotoxicity, alopecia, 
arthralgias, and GI disturbances.
Use 1⁄4–1⁄3 dose when given with xanthine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., allopurinol). Patients with low 
or absent thiopurine methyl transferase (TPMT) or nucleotide diphosphatase (NUDT15) may be 
at increased risk for severe and life-­threatening myelotoxicity. Consider alternative therapy in 
patients with homozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency and reduced dosages in patients with het­
erozygous deficiency. Individuals with the low functioning alleles for NUDT15 are common among 
Asian ancestry and Hispanic ethnicity.
Severe anemia has been reported when used in combination with captopril or enalapril. Monitor 
CBC, platelets, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, BUN, and creatinine. Pancytopenia and bone 
marrow suppression have been reported with concomitant use of pegylated interferon and ribavirin 
in patients with hepatitis C. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has been reported. 
Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31).
Administer oral doses with food to minimize GI discomfort. To minimize infant exposure via breast­
milk, avoid breastfeeding for 4–6 hr after administering a maternal dose.

Ophthalmic:
≥1 yr and adult: Instill one drop into the affected eye(s) BID, 8–12 hr apart, × 2 days, followed by 
one drop once daily for the next 5 days.
No longer recommended for otitis media due to increased resistant pathogens.
Contraindicated in hypersensitivity to macrolides and history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic 
dysfunction associated with prior use. Use with caution in impaired hepatic function, GFR <10 mL/min 
(limited data), hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, bradycardia, arrhythmias, prolonged QT intervals, and 
receiving medications that can cause the aforementioned conditions of caution. May cause increase in 
hepatic enzymes, cholestatic jaundice, GI discomfort, and pain at injection site (IV use). Compared with 
other macrolides, less risk for drug interactions. Nelfinavir may increase azithromycin levels; monitor for 
liver enzyme abnormalities and hearing impairment. Vomiting, diarrhea, and nausea have been reported 
at higher frequency in otitis media with 1-­day dosing regimen. Exacerbations of myasthenia gravis/
syndrome, serious skin reactions (e.g., SJS and TEN), infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, decreased 
lymphocytes, and elevated bilirubin, BUN, and creatinine have been reported. CNS penetration is poor.
Aluminum-­ and magnesium-­containing antacids decrease absorption. Tablet and oral suspension 
dosage forms may be administered with or without food. Extended-­release oral suspension should 
be taken on an empty stomach (at least 1 hr before or 2 hr following a meal). Intravenous adminis­
tration is over 1–3 hr; do not give as a bolus or IM injection.
Ophthalmic Use: Do not wear contact lenses. Eye irritation is the most common side effect.

Avoid abrupt withdrawal of drug. Use with caution in patients with seizure disorder or 
impaired renal function. Approximately 70%–80% of the drug is excreted in the urine 
unchanged. Administer oral doses with food or milk.
Adverse effects: Drowsiness, fatigue, nausea, vertigo, psychiatric disturbances, rash, urinary 
frequency, and hypotonia. Avoid abrupt withdrawal of intrathecal therapy to prevent potential life-­
threatening events (rhabdomyolysis, multiple organ-­system failure, and death).
Cases of intrathecal mass at the tip of the implanted catheter leading to withdrawal symptoms have 
been reported. Inadvertent subcutaneous injection may occur with improper access of the reservoir 
refill septum and may result in an overdose. Sterile techniques must be used with intrathecal use 
accounting for all nonsterile external surfaces.
Usual maintenance oral dosage range observed from a collection of smaller prospective and retro­
spective studies suggest following (see dosage section for initial dose titration):
<2 yr: 10–20 mg/24 hr ÷ Q8 hr to a maximum of 40 mg/24 hr
2–7 yr: 20–40 mg/24 hr ÷ Q8 hr to a maximum of 60 mg/24 hr

Use with caution in hypothyroidism, cirrhosis, ulcerative colitis, and history of allergic 
reactions to corticosteroids. See Chapter 8 for relative steroid potencies and doses based 
on body surface area. Betamethasone is inadequate when used alone for adrenocortical 
insufficiency because its minimal mineralocorticoid properties. Like all steroids, may cause 
­hypertension, pseudotumor cerebri, acne, Cushing syndrome, adrenal axis suppression, GI 
­bleeding, hyperglycemia, and osteoporosis.
Betamethasone is a substrate for CYP 450 3A4, and use with a strong inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole 
and itraconazole) may lead to increased exposure and side effects of betamethasone.

Contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant and with concurrent use of 
cyclosporine (increases bosentan concentrations) or glyburide (increases risk for 
hepatotoxicity). Due to these risks, bosentan is available only through the Tracleer REMS program 
where prescribers and pharmacies need to be certified. See www.tracleerrems.com or call 
1-­866-­228-­3546 for more information.
Baseline and monthly monitoring of serum aminotransferases and bilirubin; and pregnancy tests for 
females of reproductive potential (two forms of birth control required) are required. Use should be 
avoided in patients with preexisting hepatic impairment (baseline aminotransferases >3 times the 
usual normal limit).
May cause respiratory tract infections, anemia (dose related), edema, increased liver amino­
transferases (see dosage modification; higher incidence in adults) and pyrexia. Decreased 
sperm counts, liver cirrhosis, liver failure, DRESS, thrombocytopenia, and sinusitis have been 
reported.
Bosentan is substrate for the CYP2C9 and 3A4 enzymes, and OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 transporter. It also 
induces CYP2C9 and 3A4; may decrease sildenafil levels. Reduces the effectiveness of hormonal 
contraceptives.

Nasal inhalation:
≥6 to <12 yr: Start at 1 spray in each nostril once daily. If needed, increase to 2 sprays each nostril 
once daily. Then reduce dose back to initial dose when symptoms improve. Max. nasal dose: 
128 mCg/24 hr (4 sprays/24 hr).
≥12 yr to adult: Start at 2 sprays in each nostril once daily. When symptoms improve, reduce dose 
to 1 spray each nostril once daily. Usual max. dose is 128 mCg/24 hr (4 sprays/24 hr) but some 
may require 256 mCg/24 hr (8 sprays/24 hr) initially with a subsequent reduced dosage to improve 
symptoms.
Crohn disease (Encort EC and generics):
Child ≥6 yr (see remarks): Data are limited; only the following dosages have been reported. 
Additional studies are needed.
Active disease: 9 mg PO once daily × 7–8 wk
Maintenance of remission: 6 mg PO once daily × 3–4 wk
In addition, a report in 10–19 yr old children demonstrated higher remission rates with an induc­
tion dose of 12 mg PO once daily × 4 wk, followed by 9 mg PO once daily × 3 wk, followed by 
6 mg PO once daily × 3 wk.
Adult:
Active disease: 9 mg PO QAM × 8 wk; if remission is not achieved, a second 8-­wk course may be 
given.
Maintenance of remission: 6 mg PO once daily for up to 3 mo. If symptom control is maintained 
at 3 mo, taper dosage to compete cessation. Remission therapy beyond 3 mo has not shown to 
provide substantial clinical benefit.
Ulcerative colitis, induction of remission (Uceris and generics):
Adult:
Extended release oral tablet: 9 mg PO QAM for up to 8 wk
Rectal foam: 2 mg PR BID × 2 wk followed by 2 mg PR once daily × 4 wk
Reduce maintenance dose to as low as possible to control symptoms. May cause pharyngitis, 
cough, epistaxis, nasal irritation, and HPA-­axis suppression. Rinse mouth after each use 
via the oral inhalation route. Nebulized budesonide has been shown effective in mild to moderate 
croup at doses of 2 mg × 1. Ref: N Engl J Med 331(5):285.
Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with the inhaled route. 
Anaphylactic reactions, rectal bleeding, peripheral edema, mood swings, increased blood 
pressure, rash, and benign intracranial hypertension have been reported with oral route of 
administration.
Safety and effectiveness for mild/moderate Crohn disease have been established for children 
8–17 yr old weighing ≥25 kg. Safety and efficacy have NOT been established in pediatric patients 
for the maintenance of clinical remission of mild/moderate Crohn disease. Although the reported 
safety profile in pediatric Crohn disease is consistent with adults, there may be increased risk for 
decreased growth velocity due to higher systemic absorption of corticosteroids in children with 
Crohn disease.
CYP 450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, erythromycin, protease inhibitors) or significant hepatic 
impairment may increase systemic exposure of budesonide (inhalation and PO routes).

apy. Discontinue therapy if no improvement in nasal symptoms after 3 wk of continuous 
therapy.
Pulmicort Flexhaler is a breath activated device which requires the patient to have an inspiratory flow 
rate of approximately 60 L/min for optimal drug delivery.
Pregnancy category is “B” for inhalation routes of administration and “C” for the oral and rectal 
routes. Breast feeding category is “2” for inhalation routes and “?” for the rectal route. 
Breast feeding with the oral route of administration may result in budesonide exposure to the 
infant up to 10 times higher than that by the inhalation route. Do not crush or chew the oral 
capsule dosage form. 
BUDESONIDE AND FORMOTEROL
Symbicort
Corticosteroid and long-­acting 
β2-­adrenergic agonist
Aerosol inhaler:
80 mCg budesonide + 4.5 mCg formoterol fumarate dihydrate (6.9 g delivers 60 inhalations, 10.2 g 
delivers approximately 120 inhalations)
160 mCg budesonide + 4.5 mCg formoterol fumarate dihydrate (6 g delivers 60 inhalations, 10.2 g 
delivers approximately 120 inhalations)
 5–11 yr (NIH Asthma Guideline 2007 recommendations) and 6 to <12 yr (FDA labeling); see 
remarks: Two inhalations BID of 80 mCg budesonide + 4.5 mCg formoterol; max. dose: 4 
inhalations/24 hr.
≥12 yr and adult:
No prior inhaled steroid use: Start with two inhalations BID of 80 mCg budesonide + 4.5 mCg 
formoterol OR 160 mCg budesonide + 4.5 mCg formoterol, depending on severity.
Prior low to medium doses of inhaled steroid use: Start with two inhalations BID of 80 mCg 
budesonide + 4.5 mCg formoterol.
Prior medium to high doses of inhaled steroid use: Start with two inhalations BID of 160 mCg 
budesonide + 4.5 mCg formoterol.
Max. dose: 2 inhalations of 160 mCg budesonide + 4.5 mCg formoterol BID
See Budesonide and Formoterol for remarks. Should only be used for patients not adequately 
controlled on other asthma-­controller medications (e.g., low-­to-­medium dose inhaled 
corticosteroids) or whose disease severity requires the use of two maintenance therapies. 
Titrate to the lowest effective strength after asthma is adequately controlled.
Reported side effects at ≥3% and more frequently compared with budesonide alone include URI, 
pharyngitis, headache, and rhinitis.
As needed rescue therapy with budesonide/formoterol was found to be noninferior to maintenance 
budesonide and PRN terbutaline for controlling symptoms in mild asthmatics ≥12 yr old (Ref. 
N Engl J Med 378[20]:1877).
Proper patient education including dosage administration technique is essential; see patient ­package

Doses expressed in mg of calcium acetate.
Hyperphosphatemia (see remarks):
Child and adolescent: Start with 667–1000 mg PO with each meal. If needed, dosage may 
be titrated every 2–4 wk up to the recommended limits from the KDOQI guidelines:
Calcium intake as phosphate binders: 1500 mg elemental calcium/24 hr
Total calcium intake from all sources: 2000 mg elemental calcium/24 hr
Adult: Start with 1334 mg PO with each meal. Dosage may be increased gradually every 2–3 wk to 
bring serum phosphorous levels below 6 mg/dL, as long as hypercalcemia does not occur. Most 
patients require 2001–2668 mg PO with each meal.
Contraindicated in ventricular fibrillation. Use with caution in renal impairment, as 
hypercalcemia may develop in end-­stage renal failure. Nausea and hypercalcemia may 
occur. Approximately 40% of dose is systemically absorbed under fasting conditions and 
up to 30% in nonfasting conditions. May reduce absorption of fluoroquinolones, 
tetracyclines, iron, and effectiveness of polystyrene sulfonate. May potentiate effects of 
digoxin.

Epidiolex is a schedule V controlled substance. Common side effects include somnolence, 
decreased appetite, diarrhea, elevated transaminase (dose related), fatigue, malaise and 
asthenia, rash, insomnia, and sleep disorder. Suicidal behavior and ideation and 
respiratory failure have been reported.
Monitor ALT, AST, and total bilirubin at baseline and 1, 3, 6 mo initially and periodically thereafter. 
More frequent monitoring is recommended with concurrent valproic acid or clobazam. Reduce dose 
or discontinue use in the presence of hepatic impairment.
Epidiolex is a substrate for CYP 450 2C19 and 3A4; other moderate/strong inducers or inhibitors for 
these enzymes may affect its overall exposure. May increase the effects/toxicity of clobazam and 
diazepam because it may inhibit CYP 450 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, and 2C19. May inhibit the UGT 1A9 
and 2B7 transporters.
Teratogen data limited only to animal studies with evidence of developmental toxicities at similar 
exposure concentrations in humans receiving therapeutic doses. Patients exposed to cannabidiol 
during pregnancy are encouraged to register with the North American Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy

Adolescent and adult: Initially, 12.5–25 mg/dose PO BID–TID; increase weekly if necessary by 25 mg/
dose to max. dose: 450 mg/24 hr. Usual dosage range: 25–100 mg/24 hr ÷ BID.
Onset within 15–30 min of administration. Peak effect within 1–2 hr. Adjust dose with renal 
failure (see  Chapter 31). Should be administered on an empty stomach 1 hr before or 2 
hr after meals. Titrate to minimal effective dose. Lower doses should be used in patients 
with sodium and water depletion because of diuretic therapy.
Use with caution in collagen vascular disease and concomitant potassium sparing diuretics. Avoid 
use with dialysis with high-flux membranes as anaphylactoid reactions have been reported. May 
cause rash, proteinuria, neutropenia, cough, angioedema (head, neck and intestine), hyperkalemia, 
hypotension, or diminution of taste perception (with long term use). Known to decrease aldosterone 
and increase renin production. Do not coadminister with angiotensin receptor blockers or aliskiren 
as use has been associated with increased risks for hypotension, hyperkalemia, and acute renal 
failure. Captopril is a CYP 450 2D6 substrate. Use with sirolimus, everolimus,  temsirolimus, or 
sacubitril may increase risk for angioedema.
Captopril should be discontinued as soon as possible when pregnancy is detected.

Adult (IV; indicated as replacement therapy for PO carbamazepine when PO route is not feasible): 
Determine IV daily dose by taking 70% of the established total daily oral dosage and dividing into 
4 equal doses to be administered Q6 hr. Each dose is further diluted in 100 mL of compatible fluid 
and infused over 30 min. Use is NOT recommended >7 days.
Contraindicated for patients taking monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or who are sensitive to 
tricyclic antidepressants. Should not be used in combination with clozapine, owing to increased 
risk for bone marrow suppression and agranulocytosis. Increased risk for severe dermatologic 
reactions (e.g., Stevens-­Johnson syndrome [SJS] and toxic epidermal necrolysis [TEN]) has been 
associated with the HLA-­B*1502 (prevalent among Asian descent) and HLA-­A*3101 (prevalent 
among Japanese, Native American, Southern Indian, and some Arabic ancestry) alleles.
Erythromycin, diltiazem, verapamil, cefixime, cimetidine, itraconazole, aprepitant, and INH may increase 
serum levels. Carbamazepine may decrease activity of warfarin, direct-­acting oral anticoagulants 
(e.g., rivaroxaban, apixaban), doxycycline, oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, theophylline, phenytoin, 
benzodiazepines, ethosuximide, and valproic acid. Carbamazepine is a CYP 450 3A3/4 substrate and 
inducer of CYP 450 1A2, 2C, and 3A3/4. The enzyme-­inducing effects may increase effects/toxicity of 
cyclophosphamide. CYP 450 3A4 inhibitors may increase carbamazepine levels/toxicity.
Suggested dosing intervals for specific dosage forms: extended-­release tabs or caps (BID); chewable 
and immediate-­release tablets (BID–TID); suspension (QID).
Doses may be administered with food. Do not crush or chew extended-­release dosage forms. Shake 
bottle well prior to dispensing oral suspension dosage form, and do not administer simultaneously 
with other liquid medicines or diluents.
Drug metabolism typically increases after the first month of therapy initiation due to hepatic 
autoinduction.
Therapeutic blood levels for seizures: 4–12 mg/L. Recommended serum sampling time: obtain trough 
level within 30 min prior to an oral dose. Steady state is typically achieved 1 mo following the initia­
tion of therapy (following enzymatic autoinduction). Levels obtained prior to steady state are useful for 
preventing toxicity. Blood trough levels of 7–10 mg/L have been recommended for bipolar disorders.
Side effects include sedation, dizziness, diplopia, aplastic anemia, neutropenia, urinary retention, 
nausea, SIADH, and SJS. Suicidal behavior or ideation, hypogammaglobulinemia, and onychomade­
sis have been reported. Approximately one-third of patients who had hypersensitivity reactions will 
also experience the hypersensitivity to oxcarbazepine. Pretreatment complete blood counts (CBCs) 
and liver function tests (LFTs) are suggested. Patient should be monitored for hematologic and 
hepatic toxicity. Most common side effects with the IV route, dizziness, somnolence, blurred vision, 
diplopia, headache, infusion-­related reaction, infusion site pain, and anemia.
Adjust dose in renal impairment (see Chapter 31). Do not use IV dosage form in moderate/severe 
renal impairment (GFR <30 mL/min) due to accumulation of betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium, 
which may be nephrotoxic.

to a maximum of 80 mg/24 hr.
Immediate-­release and extended-­release products are NOT interchangeable on a mg-to-mg basis. 
Contraindicated in asthma or related bronchospastic disease, sick sinus syndrome, 2nd- or 
3rd-degree heart block, severe bradycardia, cardiogenic shock, decompensated cardiac failure 
requiring IV inotropic therapy, and severe hepatic impairment (Child-­Pugh class C).
Use with caution mild/moderate hepatic impairment (Child-­Pugh class A or B), renal insufficiency, thyrotoxico­
sis, ischemic heart disease, diabetes, and cataract surgery. Avoid abrupt withdrawal of medication.
Children <3.5 yr old may have faster carvedilol clearance and may require higher dosages or TID dos­
ing. Carvedilol is a CYP 450 2D6 substrate. Digoxin, disopyramide, and dipyridamole may increase 
bradycardic effects.
Bradycardia, postural hypotension, peripheral edema, weight gain, hyperglycemia, diarrhea, 
dizziness, and fatigue are common. Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Chest pain, 
headache, vomiting, edema, and dyspnea have also been reported in children. Administering doses 
with food can reduce risk for orthostatic hypotension.

Chewable tabs: 100, 200 mg; contains aspartame
Caps: 400 mg
Infant (>6 mo) and child: 8 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q12–24 hr PO; max. dose: 400 mg/24 hr. May be 
used in infants ≥3 mo old for community-­acquired pneumonia.
Alternative dosing for acute UTI: 16 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q12 hr on day 1, followed by 
8 mg/kg/24 hr Q24 hr PO × 13 days. Max. dose: 400 mg/24 hr
Adolescent and adult: 400 mg/24 hr ÷ Q12–24 hr PO
Uncomplicated cervical, urethral, or rectal infections due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae (not recommended 
as first-line cephalosporin by the CDC; ceftriaxone is preferred, use only when ceftriaxone is not 
available): 400 mg × 1 PO plus azithromycin 1 g PO × 1 OR doxycycline 100 mg PO BID × 7 days.
Use with caution in patients with penicillin allergy or renal failure. Adverse reactions include 
diarrhea (16% incidence reported in clinical trials), abdominal pain, nausea, and 
headaches. Transient increase in AST/ALT has been reported. Activity is inadequate 
against penicillin-­resistant pneumococci.
Because of reduced bioavailability, do not use tablets for the treatment of otitis media. Probenecid 
increases serum cefixime levels. Unlike most cephalosporins, drug is excreted unchanged in 
the bile (5%–10%) and urine (50%). May increase carbamazepine serum concentrations. May 
cause false-­positive urine-­reducing substance (Clinitest), Coombs test, and nitroprusside test for 
ketones. Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31).

Contraindicated in neonates with hyperbilirubinemia. Do not administer with IV calcium-­
containing solutions or products (mixed or administered simultaneously via different lines) 
in neonates (<28 days old) because of risk of precipitation of ceftriaxone-­calcium salt. 
Cases of fatal reactions with calcium-­ceftriaxone precipitates in lung and kidneys in 
preterm and full-­term neonates have been reported. Do not administer simultaneously with 
IV calcium-­containing solutions via a Y-­site for any age group. IV calcium-­containing 
products may be administered sequentially only when the infusion lines are thoroughly 
flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid.
Use with caution in penicillin ­allergy; patients with gallbladder, biliary tract, liver, or pancreatic disease; 
presence of renal impairment; or in neonates with continuous dosing (risk for hyperbilirubinemia). In 
neonates, consider using an alternative third-­generation cephalosporin with similar activity. Unlike 
other cephalosporins, ceftriaxone is significantly cleared by the biliary route (35%–45%).
Rash, injection site pain, diarrhea, and transient increase in liver enzymes are common. May cause reversible 
cholelithiasis, sludging in gallbladder, and jaundice. May interfere with serum and urine creatinine assays 
(Jaffe method) and cause false-­positive urinary protein and urinary reducing substances (Clinitest).
For IM injections, dilute drug with either sterile water for injection or 1% lidocaine to a concentra­
tion of 250 or 350 mg/mL (250 mg/mL has lower incidence of injection site reactions). Assess 
the potential risk/benefit for using lidocaine as a diluent; see Lidocaine for additional remarks

Zyrtec-­D 12 hr: 1 tablet PO BID
Generally not recommended for treating URIs for infants. No proven benefit for infants and 
young children with URIs. The FDA does not recommend use for URIs in children <2 yr 
because of reports of increased fatalities.
May cause headache, pharyngitis, GI symptoms, dry mouth, and sedation. Aggressive reactions and 
convulsions have been reported. Has NOT been implicated in causing cardiac arrhythmias when 
used with other drugs that are metabolized by hepatic microsomal enzymes (e.g., ketoconazole, 
erythromycin).
In hepatic impairment, the following doses have been recommended:
Cetirizine:
<6 yr: Use not recommended
6–11 yr: <2.5 mg PO once daily
≥12 yr–adult: 5 mg PO once daily
Cetirizine in combination with pseudoephedrine:

Dose recommendations are just guidelines for therapy; monitoring of blood levels is essential. 
Follow hematologic status for dose-related or idiosyncratic marrow suppression. “Gray 
baby” syndrome may be seen with levels >50 mg/L. Use with caution in G6PD deficiency, 
renal or hepatic dysfunction, and neonates.
Concomitant use of phenobarbital and rifampin may lower chloramphenicol serum levels. Phenytoin 
may increase chloramphenicol serum levels. Chloramphenicol may increase the effects/toxicity 
of phenytoin, chlorpropamide, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and oral anticoagulants and decrease 
absorption of vitamin B12. Chloramphenicol is an inhibitor of CYP 450 2C9.
Therapeutic levels: Peak: 15–25 mg/L for meningitis and 10–20 mg/L for other infections. Trough: 
5–15 mg/L for meningitis and 5–10 mg/L for other infections. Recommended serum sampling 
time: trough within 30 min prior to next dose; peak 30 min after the end of infusion. Time to 
achieve steady ­state: 2–3 days for newborns; 12–24 hr for children and adults.

Malaria prophylaxis (start 1–2 wk prior to exposure and continue for 4 wk after leaving 
endemic area):
Infant and child: 5 mg/kg/dose PO every week; max. dose: 300 mg/dose
Adult: 300 mg/dose PO every week
Malaria treatment (chloroquine sensitive strains):
For treatment for malaria, consult with ID specialist or see the latest edition of the AAP Red Book.
Infant and child: 10 mg/kg/dose (max. dose: 600 mg/dose) PO × 1; followed by 5 mg/kg/dose (max. 
dose: 300 mg/dose) 6, 24, and 48 hr after the initial dose.
Adult: 600 mg/dose PO × 1; followed by 300 mg/dose 6, 24, and 48 hr after the initial dose.
Contraindicated in the presence of retinal or visual field changes and known hypersensitivity 
to 4-­aminoquinoline compounds. Use with caution in liver disease, preexisting auditory 
damage or seizures, G6PD deficiency, psoriasis, porphyria, or concomitant hepatotoxic 
drugs. May cause nausea, vomiting, electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities, prolonged QT 
interval, blurred vision, retinal and corneal changes (reversible corneal opacities), 
headaches, confusion, skeletal muscle weakness, increased liver enzymes, and hair 
depigmentation. SJS, TEN, anaphylactic reactions, and maculopathy and macular 
degeneration have been reported. False-­positive test for urine amphetamine screen may 
occur.
Antacids, ampicillin, and kaolin may decrease the absorption of chloroquine (allow 4-­hr interval 
between these drugs and chloroquine). Cimetidine may increase effects/toxicity of chloroquine. May 
increase serum cyclosporine levels. Coadministration with mefloquine may increase risk of convul­
sions. May reduce the antibody response to intradermal human diploid-­cell rabies vaccine.
Monitor CBCs periodically with therapies of prolonged duration. Adjust dose in renal failure (see 
Chapter 31).

Biologic potency and oral absorption may be greater than ergocalciferol (vitamin D2). 
Requires activation by the liver (25-­hydroxylation) and kidney (1-­hydroxylation) to the 
active form, calcitriol. Recommended time period to recheck serum 25-­OH vitamin D is 3 
mo after initiation or change in dosage.
Monitor serum Ca2+, PO4, 25-­0H vitamin D (goal level for infant and child: ≥20 ng/mL) and alkaline 
phosphate. Serum Ca2+, PO4 product should be <70 mg/dL to avoid ectopic calcification. Serum 
25-­OH vitamin D level of ≥35 ng/mL has been used in cystic fibrosis patients to decrease the risk 
of hyperparathyroidism and bone loss.
Serum 25-­OH vitamin D levels ≥100 ng/mL is considered toxic. Toxic effects in infants may result 
in nausea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, polydipsia, polyuria, muscle 
weakness, muscle/joint pain, confusion, and fatigue; renal damage may also occur.

Ciclesonide is a prodrug hydrolyzed to an active metabolite, des-­ciclesonide via esterases in 
nasal mucosa and lungs; further metabolism via hepatic CYP3A4 and 2D6. Concurrent use 
with ketoconazole and other CYP 450 3A4 inhibitors may increase systemic des-­ciclesonide 
levels. Use with caution and monitor in hepatic impairment.
Oral inhalation (asthma): Rinse mouth after each use. May cause headache, arthralgia, nasal 
congestion, nasopharyngitis, and URIs. Routinely monitor growth of pediatric patients. Maximum 
therapeutic benefit may not be achieved until 4 wk after initiation; consider dose increase if 
response is inadequate after 4 wk after initial dosage.
Intranasal (allergic rhinitis): Clear nasal passages prior to use. May cause otalgia, epistaxis, 
nasopharyngitis, and headache. Nasal septal perforation has been reported. Patients should be 
free of nasal disease, except for allergic rhinitis, before starting therapy. Monitor linear growth of 
pediatric patients routinely. Onset of action: 24–48 hr; further improvement observed over 1–2 wk 
in seasonal allergic rhinitis or 5 wk in perennial allergic rhinitis. Discontinue use if nasal erosion, 
ulceration, or perforation occurs.

BK virus hemorrhagic cystitis (limited data and other regimens exist): 1 mg/kg/dose IV once weekly 
WITHOUT probenecid.
Contraindicated in hypersensitivity to probenecid or sulfa-­containing drugs; sCr >1.5 mg/dL, 
CrCl ≤55 mL/min, urine protein ≥100 mg/dL (2+ proteinuria), direct intraocular injection 
of cidofovir, and concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Renal impairment is the major dose-­
limiting toxicity. IV NS prehydration and probenecid must be used (unless not indicated) to 
reduce risk of nephrotoxicity. May also cause nausea, vomiting, headache, rash, metabolic 
acidosis, uveitis, decreased intraocular pressure, and neutropenia.
Reported criteria for defining renal dysfunction in children include a sCr >1.5 mg/dL, GFR <90 mL/
min/1.73 m2, and >2+ proteinuria. For adults, reduce dose to 3 mg/kg if sCr increases 0.3–0.4 
mg/dL from baseline. Discontinue therapy if sCr increases ≥0.5 mg/dL from baseline or develop­
ment of ≥3+ proteinuria.

Systemic fluoroquinolones are associated with disabling and potentially permanent side 
effects of the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system.
Can cause GI upset, renal failure, and seizures. GI symptoms, headache, restlessness, and rash are 
common side effects. Peripheral neuropathy, pseudotumor cerebri, severe hepatic necrosis, and 
psychiatric reactions have been reported. Use with caution in children <18 yr (like other quino­
lones, tendon rupture can occur during or after therapy, especially with concomitant corticosteroid 
use), alkalinized urine (crystalluria), seizures, excessive sunlight (photosensitivity), and renal 
dysfunction (adjust systemic dose in renal failure; see Chapter 31). Blood glucose disturbances 
(hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia) have been reported in diabetic patients receiving insulin or oral 
hypoglycemic agent.
Do not use otic suspension with perforated tympanic membranes and with viral infections of the 
external ear canal.
For dosing in obese patients, use an adjusted body weight (ABW). ABW = ideal body weight + 0.45 
(total body weight − ideal body weight).
Combinational antimicrobial therapy is recommended for anthrax. For penicillin-­susceptible strains, 
consider changing to high-­dose amoxicillin (25–35 mg/kg/dose TID PO). See www.bt.cdc.gov for 
the latest information.
Inhibits CYP 450 1A2. Ciprofloxacin can increase effects and/or toxicity of caffeine, methotrexate, 
theophylline, warfarin, tizanidine (excessive sedation and dangerous hypotension), and cyclospo­
rine. Probenecid increases ciprofloxacin levels.
Do not administer antacids or other divalent salts with or within 2–4 hr of oral ciprofloxacin dose. 
Do not administer oral suspension through feeding tubes, because this dosage form adheres to 
the tube.

Seizures (generalized or partial, as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy; limited data and 
­prescribing information from Canada and the United Kingdom):
Infant and child (<2 yr): Start at 0.5–1 mg/kg/24 hr (max. dose: 5 mg/24 hr) PO ÷ BID, if needed 
and tolerated, slowly increase dosage at 5–7 days intervals up to the maximum of 10 mg/kg/24 hr.
2–16 yr: Start at 5 mg PO once daily, if needed and tolerated, slowly increase dosage at 5–7 day 
intervals up to the maximum of 40 mg/kg/24 hr. Usual dosage range: 10–20 mg/24 hr or 0.3–1 
mg/kg/24 hr ÷ BID.
Use with caution in hepatic impairment (dose adjustment may be needed). Do not 
discontinue use abruptly, as seizures/withdrawal symptoms may occur. Common side 
effects include constipation, drooling, ataxia, drowsiness, insomnia, aggressive behavior, 
cough, and fever. SJS, TEN, urinary retention, hypothermia, leukopenia, and 
thrombocytopenia have been reported.
Do not use in combination with azelastine, olanzapine, sodium oxybate, and thioridazine; increased 
risk of adverse events. Proton pump inhibitors, azole antifungal agents (e.g., itraconazole and 
ketoconazole), St. John’s Wort, grapefruit juice, CNS depressants, cimetidine, and calcium channel 
blockers may increase the effects/toxicity of clobazam. Use with opioids may result in profound 
sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and mortality. Carbamazepine, rifamycin derivatives (e.g., 
rifampin), and theophylline may decrease the effects of clobazam. Clobazam is a major substrate 
for CYP 450 2C19 and P-­glycoprotein, minor substrate for CYP 450 2B6 and 3A4, inhibitor of CYP 
450 2D6, and inducer of CYP 3A4. Carefully review the patient’s medication profile for other drug 
interactions each time clobazam is initiated or when a new drug is added to a regimen containing 
clobazam.
Doses may be taken with or without food. Tablets may be crushed and mixed with applesauce.
Oral film (Sympazan) uses same PO dosage with the following method for administration: apply film 
on top of the tongue, allow it to dissolve, and swallow saliva in a normal manner. Do not chew, 
spit, or talk while film is dissolving. Doses may be taken with or without food but do not administer 
with liquids.

 Hypertension (use immediate-­release products unless noted):
Child (PO): 5–10 mCg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q8–12 hr initially; if needed, increase at 5-­ to 7-­day 
intervals to 5–25 mCg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q6 hr; max. dose: 25 mCg/kg/24 hr up to 0.9 mg/24 hr.
≥12 yr and adult (PO): 0.1 mg BID initially; increase in 0.1 mg/24 hr increments at weekly intervals 
until desired response is achieved (usual range: adolescent: 0.2–0.6 mg/24 hr ÷ BID; adult: 
0.1–0.8 mg/24 hr ÷ BID), max. dose: 2.4 mg/24 hr
Transdermal patch (each patch lasts 7 days by rotating application sites but more frequent patch 
change at every 5 days may be needed for children):
Child: conversion to patch only after establishing an optimal oral dose first. Use a transdermal 
dosage closest to the established total oral daily dose.
Adult: Initial 0.1 mg/24 hr patch for first week. May increase dose by 0.1 mg/24 hr at 1–2 wk intervals 
PRN. Usual range: 0.1–0.3 mg/24 hr. Doses >0.6 mg/24 hr do not provide additional benefit.

>45 kg: Start with 0.1 mg QHS; if needed, increase by 0.1 mg/24 hr every 3–7 days as increments 
with BID, TID, and then QID dosing up to the max. dose of 0.4 mg/24 hr.
Extended-­release product (Kapvay and generics, PO): Start with 0.1 mg QHS; if needed, increase by 
0.1 mg every 7 days by administering the dose BID up to a maximum of 0.4 mg/24 hr. Depending 
on dosage level, BID dosing should be either the same amount or with the higher dosage given at 
bedtime. If therapy is to be discontinued, slowly reduce dosage at ≤0.1 mg every 3 to 7 days to 
avoid withdrawal.
Neonatal abstinence syndrome, adjunctive therapy (use immediate-­release product; limited data): 
0.5–1 mCg/kg/dose Q4–6 hr PO; use Q6 hr interval for preterm neonates.
Side effects: Dry mouth, dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, constipation, anorexia, arrhythmias, 
and local skin reactions with patch. Somnolence, fatigue, URIs irritability, throat pain, 
insomnia, nightmares, and emotional disorder were reported as common side effects in 
ADHD clinical trials. May worsen sinus node dysfunction and AV block especially for 
patients taking other sympatholytic drugs. Do not abruptly discontinue; signs of 
sympathetic overactivity may occur; taper gradually over >1 wk.
β-­blockers may exacerbate rebound hypertension during and following the withdrawal of clonidine. If 
patient is receiving both clonidine and a β-­blocker and clonidine is to be discontinued, the β-­blocker 
should be withdrawn several days prior to tapering the clonidine. If converting from clonidine over to 
a β-­blocker, introduce the β-­blocker several days after discontinuing clonidine (after taper).
Monitor heart rate when used with digitalis, calcium channel blockers, and β-­blockers. Use with dil­
tiazem or verapamil may result in sinus bradycardia. Use with neuroleptics may induce/exacerbate 
orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and fatigue. Consider using lower dosages in renal impairment 
because the drug is primarily eliminated unchanged in the urine and signs of bradycardia, seda­
tion, and hypotension may occur.
T½: 44–72 hr (neonate), 6–20 hr (adult). Onset of action (antihypertensive): 0.5–1 hr for oral route, 
2–3 days for transdermal route. Do not use transdermal route while patient is undergoing a mag­
netic resonance imaging (MRI) procedure; transdermal patches contains metals and may result in 
serious patient burns when undergoing MRI.

Anticholinergic, mydriatic agent
Ophthalmic solution: 0.5% (15 mL), 1% (2, 5, 15 mL), 2% (2, 5, 15 mL); may contain benzalkonium 
chloride
 Administer dose approximately 40–50 min prior to examination/procedure.
Infant: Use of cyclopentolate/phenylephrine (Cyclomydril) due to lower cyclopentolate 
concentration and reduced risk of systemic side effects.
Child and adolescent: 1 drop of 0.5%–1% solution OU, followed by repeat drop, if necessary, 
in 5 min. Use 2% solution for heavily pigmented iris.
Adult: 1 drop of 1% solution OU followed by another drop OU in 5 min. Use 2% solution for heavily 
pigmented iris.
Do not use in narrow-­angle glaucoma. May cause a burning sensation, behavioral 
disturbance, tachycardia, and loss of visual accommodation. Psychotic reactions and 
behavioral disturbances have been reported in children. To minimize absorption, apply 
pressure over nasolacrimal sac for at least 2 min. CNS and cardiovascular side effects are 
common with the 2% solution in children. Avoid feeding infants within 4 hr of dosing to 
prevent potential feeding intolerance.

movement disturbances, and impaired consciousness have been reported, especially in 
liver transplant patients. Psoriasis patients previously treated with PUVA and, to a lesser 
extent, methotrexate or other immunosuppressive agents, UVB, coal tar, or radiation 
therapy are at increased risk for skin malignancies when taking Neoral or Gengraf.
Opportunistic infections and activation of latent viral infections have been reported.
BK virus–associated nephropathy has been observed in renal transplant patients.
Use caution with concomitant use of other nephrotoxic drugs (e.g., amphotericin B, aminoglycosides, 
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and tacrolimus).
Plasma concentrations increased with the use of boceprevir, telaprevir, fluconazole, ketoconazole, 
itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, voriconazole, nefazodone, diltiazem, verapamil, nica­
rdipine, carvedilol, and corticosteroids. Plasma concentrations decreased with the use of carba­
mazepine, nafcillin, rifampin, oxcarbazepine, bosentan, phenobarbital, octreotide, and phenytoin. 
May increase bosentan, dabigatran, methotrexate, repaglinide, and anthracycline antibiotics (e.g., 
doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, daunorubicin) levels/effects/toxicity. Use with nifedipine may result in 
gingival hyperplasia. Cyclosporine is a substrate and inhibitor for CYP 450 3A4 and P-­glycoprotein.
Children may require dosages 2–3 times higher than adults. Plasma half-­life 6–24 hr.
Monitor trough levels (just prior to a dose at steady state). Steady state is generally achieved after 
3–5 days of continuous dosing. Interpretation will vary based on treatment protocol and assay 
methodology (RIA monoclonal vs. RIA polyclonal vs. HPLC), as well as whole blood vs. serum 
sample. Additional monitoring and dosage adjustments may be necessary in renal and hepatic 
impairment or when changing dosage forms.
For ophthalmic use: Ocular burning may occur. Remove contact lens prior to use; lens may be inserted 
15 min after dose administration. May be used with artificial tears but need to be separated by 15 
min for one another.

supplementation may be necessary. Red cell aplasia and severe anemia associated with 
neutralizing antibodies to erythropoietin have been reported.
USE IN CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Higher doses may be needed for pediatric patients being switched 
from epoetin alfa than those for naïve patients. May cause edema, fatigue, GI disturbances, head­
ache, blood pressure changes, fever, cardiac arrhythmia/arrest, infections and myalgia. Higher risk 
for mortality and serious cardiovascular events have been reported with higher targeted hemoglobin 
levels (>11 g/dL). If hemoglobin levels do not increase or reach targeted levels despite appropriate 
dose titrations over a 12 wk period, (1) do not administer higher doses and use the lowest dose that

USE IN CANCER: Use only for anemia due to myelosuppressive chemotherapy; not effective in reducing 
the need for transfusions in patients with anemia not due to chemotherapy. Shortened survival and 
time to tumor progression have been reported in patients with various cancers. May cause fatigue, 
fever, edema, dizziness, headache, GI disturbances, arthralgia/myalgia, and rash. Use lowest dose to 
avoid transfusions and do not exceed hemoglobin levels >12 g/dL; increased frequency of adverse 
events, including mortality and thrombotic vascular events, have been reported. Prescribers and 
hospitals must enroll in and comply with the ESA APPRISE Oncology Program to prescribe and/or

has ranged from 0.2–1 mCg/kg/hr.
Use with caution with other vasodilating or negative chronotropic agents (additive 
pharmacodynamic effects), hepatic impairment (decrease drug clearance; consider dose 
reduction), advanced heart block, hypovolemia, diabetes mellitus, chronic hypertension, and 
severe ventricular dysfunction. Prolonged use >24 hr may be associated with tolerance and 
tachyphylaxis and dose-­related side effects (ARDS, respiratory failure and agitation). 
Withdrawal symptoms within 24 hr after discontinuing dexmedetomidine have been reported 
in ∼5% of adults receiving the medication up to 7 days regardless of dosage; no withdrawal 
symptoms were seen in adults after discontinuing therapy lasting <6 hr in duration.
Hypotension and bradycardia are common side effects; may be more pronounced in hypovolemia, 
diabetes or chronic hypertension. Transient hypertension has been observed during loading doses. QT 
prolongation, hypernatremia, sinus arrest, and polyuria have been reported. Do not abruptly withdraw 
therapy, as withdrawal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, and agitation) are possible; taper the dose 
when discontinuing use.

Use with caution in presence of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and renal or hepatic 
impairment (drug elimination may be decreased). Avoid use in known serious structural 
cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, coronary artery 
disease, or other serious cardiac problems that may increase risk of sympathomimetic 
effects of amphetamines (sudden death, stroke, and MI have been reported). Do not give 
with MAO inhibitors (also within 14 days of discontinuance) or general anesthetics. Use with 
proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may reduce the effectiveness of either dextroamphetamine or 
the combination with amphetamine.
DEXTROAMPHETAMINE AND AMPHETAMINE: Serotonin syndrome may occur when used with seroto­
nergic neurotransmitter medications such as MAO inhibitors, SSRIs, serotonin and norepinephrine 
reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), triptans, and TCAs. CYP 450 2D6 inhibitors may increase the effects/
toxicity of the combination medication.
Not recommended for <3 yr. Medication should generally not be used in children <5 yr old, as diag­
nosis of attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in this age group is extremely difficult 
(use in consultation with a specialist). Interrupt administration occasionally to determine need for 
continued therapy. Many side effects, including insomnia (avoid dose administration within 6 hr of 
bedtime), restlessness/irritability, anorexia, psychosis, visual disturbances, headache, vomiting, 
abdominal cramps, dry mouth, and growth failure. Paranoia, mania, peripheral vasculopathy 
(including Raynaud phenomenon), priapism, bruxism, and auditory hallucination have been 
reported. Assess for risk of abuse and dependence prior to prescribing. Tolerance develops. Same 
guidelines as for methylphenidate apply. See Amphetamine for amphetamine-­containing products.

Contraindicated in myasthenia gravis, severe respiratory insufficiency, severe hepatic 
failure, and sleep apnea syndrome. Hypotension and respiratory depression may occur. Use 
with caution in hepatic and renal dysfunction, glaucoma, shock, and depression. Do not 
use in combination with protease inhibitors. Concurrent use with CNS depressants, 
cimetidine, erythromycin, itraconazole, and valproic acid may enhance the effects of 
diazepam. Use with opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma 
and mortality. Diazepam is a substrate for CYP 450 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, and 3A5-­7, and minor 
substrate and inhibitor for CYP 450 2C19 and 3A3/4. The active desmethyldiazepam 
metabolite is a CYP 450 2C19 substrate.
Administer the conventional IV product undiluted no faster than 2 mg/min and do not mix with 
IV fluids.
In status epilepticus, diazepam must be followed by long-­acting anticonvulsants. Onset of 
­anticonvulsant effect: 1–3 min with IV route; 2–10 min with rectal route. For management of 
status epilepticus, see Chapter 1.

Hypoglycemia should be treated initially with IV glucose; diazoxide should be introduced only 
if refractory to glucose infusion. Should not be used in patients hypersensitive to thiazides 
unless benefit outweighs risk. Thiazides may enhance diazoxide’s hyperglycemic effects. 
Use with caution in renal impairment (clearance of drug is reduced); consider dosage 
reduction.
Sodium and fluid retention is common in young infants and adults and may precipitate congestive 
heart failure (CHF) in patients with compromised cardiac reserve (usually responsive to diuret­
ics). Hirsutism (reversible), GI disturbances, transient loss of taste, tachycardia, ketoacidosis, 
palpitations, rash, headache, weakness, and hyperuricemia may occur. Pulmonary hypertension 
in newborns/infant treated for hypoglycemia has been reported as resolution/improvement of the 
condition was achieved after discontinuance of diazoxide. Monitor BP closely for hypotension.
Hyperglycemic effect with PO administration occurs within 1 hr, with a duration of 8 hr.

≥10 yr: Give maintenance dose once daily
Contraindicated in patients with ventricular dysrhythmias. Use should be avoided in 
patients with preserved left ventricular systolic function. Use with caution in renal failure, 
with calcium channel blockers (may result in heart block), and with adenosine (enhanced 
depressant effects on sinoatrial [SA] and atrioventricular [AV] nodes). May cause AV block 
or dysrhythmias. In patients treated with digoxin, cardioversion, or calcium infusion, may 
lead to ventricular fibrillation (pretreatment with lidocaine may prevent this). Patients with 
beri beri heart disease may not respond to digoxin if underlying thiamine deficiency is not 
treated concomitantly. Decreased serum potassium and magnesium, or increased 
magnesium and calcium may increase risk for digoxin toxicity. For signs and symptoms of 
toxicity, see Chapter 3.
Excreted via the kidney; adjust dose in renal failure (see  Chapter 31). Therapeutic concentration: 
0.8–2 ng/mL. Higher doses may be required for supraventricular tachycardia. Neonates, pregnant 
women, and patients with renal, hepatic, or heart failure may have falsely elevated digoxin levels, 
due to the presence of digoxin-­like substances.
Digoxin is a CYP450 3A4 and P-­glycoprotein substrate. Calcium channel blockers, captopril, 
carvedilol, amiodarone, quinidine, cyclosporine, itraconazole, tetracycline, and macrolide 
antibiotics may increase digoxin levels. Use with β-­blockers and ivabradine may increase risk for 
bradycardia. Succinylcholine may cause arrhythmias in digitalized patients.
T1/2: Premature infants, 61–170 hr; full-­term neonates, 35–45 hr; infants, 18–25 hr; and children, 
35 hr.
Recommended serum sampling at steady ­state: Obtain a single level from 6 hr postdose to just 
before the next scheduled dose following 5–8 days of continuous dosing. Levels obtained prior to 
steady state may be useful in preventing toxicity.

aUse 1 mg/mL DigiFab concentration for dose accuracy
Dosage Administration:
Reconstitute each vial with 4 mL NS for a 10 mg/mL concentration and infuse IV dose over 30 min. 
If an infusion rate reaction occurs, stop infusion and restart at a slower rate. In situations of 
cardiac arrest, DigiFab can be administered as a bolus injection, but expect an increased risk 
for infusion-­related reactions. For smaller doses, vials may be reconstituted with 36 mL NS for 
a 1 mg/mL concentration.
Contraindicated if hypersensitive to sheep products. Use with caution in renal or cardiac 
failure. May cause rapidly developing severe hypokalemia, decreased cardiac output (from 
withdrawal of digoxin’s inotropic effects), rash, edema, and phlebitis. Digoxin therapy may 
be reinstituted in 3–7 days, when toxicity has been corrected. Digoxin-­immune FAB will 
interfere with digitalis immunoassay measurements to result in misleading concentrations.

To prepare infusion: see IV infusions on page i
Contraindicated in idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis (IHSS). Tachycardia, 
arrhythmias (premature ventricular contractions [PVCs]), and hypertension may 
occasionally occur (especially at higher infusion rates). Correct hypovolemic states before 
use. Increases AV conduction, and may precipitate ventricular ectopic activity.
Dobutamine has been shown to increase cardiac output and systemic pressure in pediatric patients 
of every age group. However, in premature neonates, dobutamine is less effective than dopamine in 
raising systemic blood pressure without causing undue tachycardia, and dobutamine has not been 
shown to provide any added benefit when given to such infants already receiving optimal infusions 
of dopamine.
Monitor BP and vital signs. T1/2: 2 min. Peak effects in 10–20 min. Use with linezolid may potentially 
increase blood pressure. Use with catechol-­O-­methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors (e.g., entaca­
pone) may increase heart rate, arrhythmias, and changes in blood pressure.

May cause hypotension and prolongation of cardiac conduction intervals, particularly QTc 
interval (dose-dependent effect). Common side effects include dizziness, headache, 
sedation, blurred vision, fever, chills, and sleep disorders. Rare cases of sustained 
supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, fatal cardiac arrest, and MI have been 
reported in children and adolescents.
Avoid use in patients with congenital long QTc syndrome, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, or with 
concurrent use with other drugs that increase QTc interval (e.g., erythromycin, cisapride). Drug’s 
active metabolite (hydrodolasetron) is a substrate for CYP 450 2D6 and 3A3/4 isoenzymes; 
concomitant use of enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine) may increase risk for side effects, and use 
of enzyme inducers (e.g., rifampin) may decrease dolasetron’s efficacy. Serotonin syndrome has 
been associated with concurrent use of SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline), SNRIs (e.g., duloxetine, 
venlafaxine), MAO inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and IV methylene blue.
Although no dosage adjustments are necessary, hydrodolasetron’s clearance decreases 42% with 
severe hepatic impairment and 44% with severe renal impairment.
ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities, CHF, bradyarrhythmias or 
renal impairment.
IV doses may be administered undiluted over 30 sec. 
DOPAMINE
Various generics; previously 
available as Intropin
Sympathomimetic agent
Injection: 40 mg/mL (5, 10 mL)
Prediluted injection in D5W: 0.8, 1.6, 3.2 mg/mL (250, 500 mL)
All ages:
Low dose: 2–5 mCg/kg/min IV; increases renal blood flow; minimal effect on heart rate 
and cardiac output
Intermediate dose: 5–15 mCg/kg/min IV; increases heart rate, cardiac contractility, 
cardiac output, and to a lesser extent, renal blood flow.
High dose: >15 mCg/kg/min IV; α adrenergic effects are prominent; decreases renal perfusion.
Max. dose recommended: 20–50 mCg/kg/min IV
To prepare infusion: see IV infusions on page i.
Do not use in pheochromocytoma, tachyarrhythmias, or hypovolemia. Monitor vital signs and 
blood pressure continuously. Correct hypovolemic states. Tachyarrhythmias, ectopic beats, 
hypertension, vasoconstriction, and vomiting may occur. Use with caution with phenytoin 
because hypotension and bradycardia may be exacerbated. Use with linezolid may potentially 
increase blood pressure.
Newborn infants may be more sensitive to the vasoconstrictive effects of dopamine. Children 
<2 yr of age clear dopamine faster, and high variability in neonates is exhibited.
Should be administered through a central line or large vein. Extravasation may cause tissue necrosis; 
treat with phentolamine. Do not administer into an umbilical arterial catheter.

Inhaled mucolytic
Inhalation solution: 1 mg/mL (2.5 mL; in boxes of 30s)
Cystic fibrosis:
Child ≥5 yr and adult: 2.5 mg via nebulizer once daily. Some patients may benefit 
from 2.5 mg BID.
Contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to epoetin alfa. Voice alteration, pharyngitis, 
laryngitis may result. These are generally reversible without dose adjustment. Safety and 
efficacy have not been demonstrated in patients >1 yr of continuous use.
Do not mix with other nebulized drugs. An inhaled β-­agonist may be useful before administration to 
enhance drug distribution. Chest physiotherapy should be incorporated into treatment regimen. The 
following nebulizer compressor systems have been recommended for use: Pulmo-­Aide, Pari-­Proneb, 
Mobilaire, Porta-­Neb, or PariBaby. Use of the “Sidestream” nebulizer cup can significantly reduce the 
medication administration time. 
DOXAPRAM HCL
Dopram

Injection: 20 mg/mL (20 mL); contains 0.9% benzyl alcohol
Methylxanthine-­refractory neonatal apnea (see remarks): Load with 2.5–3 mg/kg IV over 15 
min, followed by a continuous IV infusion of 1 mg/kg/hr titrated to the lowest effective dose; 
max. dose: 2.5 mg/kg/hr
Contraindicated in seizures, proven or suspected pulmonary embolism, head injuries, cerebral 
vascular accident, cerebral edema, cardiovascular or coronary artery disease, severe 
hypertension, pheochromocytoma, hyperthyroidism, and in patients with mechanical disorders 
of ventilation. Do not use with general anesthetic agents that can sensitize the heart to 
catecholamines (e.g., halothane, cyclopropane, and enflurane) to reduce the risk of cardiac 
arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. Do not initiate 
doxapram until the general anesthetic agent has been completely excreted.
Assess the benefit-­risk of benzyl alcohol exposure to neonates. Hypertension occurs with higher doses 
(>1.5 mg/kg/hr). May also cause tachycardia, arrhythmias, seizure, hyperreflexia, hyperpyrexia, 
abdominal distension, bloody stools, and sweating. Avoid extravasation into tissues.

Adult: 100 mg PO once daily
Periodontitis:
Adult: 20 mg BID PO × ≤9 mo
Use with caution in hepatic and renal disease. Generally not recommended for use in 
children <8 yr due to risk for tooth enamel hypoplasia and discoloration. However, the AAP 
Redbook recommends doxycycline as the drug of choice for rickettsial disease regardless of 
age and the use in children <8 yr for short treatment courses (≤21 days). May cause GI 
symptoms, photosensitivity, hemolytic anemia, rash, and hypersensitivity reactions. 
Increased intracranial pressure (pseudotumor cerebri), TEN, DRESS, erythema multiforme, 
and Stevens-­Johnson syndrome have been reported.
Doxycycline is approved for the treatment of anthrax (Bacillus anthracis) in combination with one or 
two other antimicrobials. If meningitis is suspected, consider using an alternative agent because 
of poor CNS penetration. Consider changing to high-­dose amoxicillin (25–35 mg/kg/dose TID PO) 
for penicillin-­susceptible strains. See www.bt.cdc.gov for the latest information.
Rifampin, barbiturates, phenytoin, and carbamazepine may increase clearance of doxycycline. 
Doxycycline may enhance the hypoprothrombinemic effect of warfarin. See Tetracycline for addi­
tional drug/food interactions and remarks.
Infuse IV over 1–4 hr. Avoid prolonged exposure to direct sunlight.

Infant <2 mo: 0.75 mg/kg/dose Q12 hr SC
Infant ≥2 mo—child 18 yr: 0.5 mg/kg/dose Q12 hr SC; max. dose: 30 mg/dose
Patients with indwelling epidural catheters/neuraxial anesthesia (≥2 mo–child 18 yr): 1 mg/kg/
dose Q24 hr SC; max. dose: 40 mg/dose. Twice-daily dosing is contraindicated for these patients. 
See remarks.
Adjust dosage for DVT prophylaxis to achieve target anti–­factor Xa levels of 0.1–0.3 units/mL for all 
children.
Adult:
Knee or hip replacement surgery: 30 mg BID SC ×7–14 days; initiate therapy 12–24 hr after sur­
gery provided hemostasis is established. Alternatively, for hip replacement surgery, 40 mg once 
daily SC ×7–14 days initially up to 3 wk thereafter; initiate therapy 9–15 hr prior to surgery.
Inhibits thrombosis by inactivating factor Xa without significantly affecting bleeding time, 
platelet function, PT, or aPTT at recommended doses. Dosages of enoxaparin, heparin, or 
other LMWHs CANNOT be used interchangeably on a unit-­for-­unit (or mg-­for-­mg) basis 
because of differences in pharmacokinetics and activity. Peak anti–­factor Xa LMWH 
activity is achieved 4 hr after a SC dose. Anti–­factor Xa LMWH is NOT THE SAME as 
unfractionated heparin anti–factor ­Xa level (used for monitoring heparin therapy).
Contraindicated in major bleeding, drug-­induced thrombocytopenia, and pork hypersensitivity. 
Use with caution in uncontrolled arterial hypertension, bleeding diathesis, history of recurrent GI 
ulcers, diabetic retinopathy, and severe renal dysfunction (reduce dose by increasing the dosage 
interval from Q12 hr to Q24 hr if GFR <30 mL/min). Prophylactic use is not recommended in 
patients with prosthetic heart valves (especially in pregnant women) due to reports of fatalities 
in patients and fetuses. Concurrent use with spinal or epidural anesthesia or spinal puncture 
has resulted in long-­term or permanent paralysis; potential benefits must be weighed against 
the risks. May cause fever, confusion, edema, nausea, hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia (including 
heparin-­induced thrombocytopenia ± thrombosis [HIT/HITTS]), hypochromic anemia, and pain/
erythema at injection site. Allergic reactions, headache, eosinophilia, alopecia, hepatocellular and 
cholestatic liver injury, and osteoporosis (long-­term use) have been reported. Protamine sulfate is 
the antidote; 1 mg protamine sulfate neutralizes 1 mg enoxaparin.
DVT prophylaxis for patients with epidural catheters/neuraxial anesthesia: If placing needle, hold 
anticoagulation for 12 hr and restart dosing no sooner than 4 hr after needle insertion. If removing 
catheter, hold anticoagulation for 12 hr and restart dosing no sooner than 2 hr after catheter 
removal.
Recommended anti–­factor Xa LMWH levels obtained 4 hr after subcutaneous dose after the third 
consecutive dose for children (anti–­factor Xa LMWH response in children is highly variable 
compared to adults):
DVT treatment: 0.5–1 units/mL
DVT prophylaxis: 0.1–0.3 units/mL
Administer by deep SC injection by having the patient lie down. Alternate administration between the 
left and right anterolateral and left and right posterolateral abdominal wall. See package insert for 
detailed SC administration recommendations. To minimize bruising, do not rub the injection site. 
IM route of administration is not recommended.

Adult: Start with 0.2–0.5 mg IM Q5–15 min PRN. If using EpiPen, Adrenaclick, Symjepi, or equivalent 
generic autoinjector, use 0.3 mg IM ×1; an additional dose may be repeated in 5–15 min.
RESPIRATORY BRONCHODILATOR USE:
SC Injection (use 1:1000 or 1 mg/mL aqueous injection):
Infant and child: 0.01 mL/kg/dose SC (max. single dose 0.5 mL); repeat Q15 min ×3–4 doses or 
Q4 hr PRN
Adult: 0.3–0.5 mg (0.3–0.5 mL)/dose SC Q20 min ×3 doses.
Nebulization (alternative to racemic epinephrine): 0.5 mL/kg of 1:1000 solution diluted in 3 mL NS; 
max. doses: ≤4 yr: 2.5 mL/dose; >4 yr: 5 mL/dose
Aerosol inhaler (Primatene Mist):
≥12 yr and adult: 1–2 inhalation(s) PO Q4 hr PRN; max. dose: 8 inhalations/24 hr
High-­dose rescue therapy for in-­hospital cardiac arrest in children after failure of an initial 
standard dose has been reported to be of no benefit compared to standard dose (N Engl J 
Med 2004;350:1722–1730).
May produce arrhythmias, tachycardia, hypertension, headaches, nervousness, nausea, vomiting, and 
rare cases of stress cardiomyopathy. Necrosis may occur at site of repeated local injection. Rare 
cases of serious skin and soft tissue infections, including necrotizing fasciitis and myonecrosis, have 
been reported with IM or deep SC injections.
Concomitant use of noncardiac selective β-­blockers, MAO inhibitors, COMT inhibitors, clonidine, or 
tricyclic antidepressants may enhance epinephrine’s pressor response. Chlorpromazine, diuretics, 
nitrates, or α-­blockers may reverse the pressor response. Do not use products containing chlorobuta­
nol for ophthalmic use, as it may be harmful to the corneal endothelium.
ETT doses should be diluted with NS to a volume of 3–5 mL before administration. Follow with several 
positive pressure ventilations.
Hypersensitivity reactions: For bronchial asthma and certain allergic manifestations (e.g., angioedema, 
urticaria, serum sickness, anaphylactic shock), use epinephrine SC. Patients with anaphylaxis may ben­
efit from IM administration. The adult IV dose for hypersensitivity reactions or to relieve bronchospasm 
usually ranges from 0.1 to 0.25 mg injected slowly over 5–10 min Q5–15 min as needed. Neonates may 
be given a dose of 0.01 mg/kg body weight; for infants, 0.05 mg is an adequate initial dose, and this 
may be repeated at 20-­ to 30-­min intervals in the management of asthma attacks.
Due to the inconsistent availability of autoinjector products, periodic re­education of available device 
may be necessary. See respective autoinjector product for proper dose administration methods 
including methods to prevent injury and/or inadvertent dose administration to the individual admin­
istering the dose. Accidental injection into the digits, hand, or feet may result in the loss of blood flow 
to the affected area. Do not inject into the buttock area.

Anemia in chronic renal failure (see remarks for dosage adjustment and withholding 
therapy): SC/IV (IV preferred for hemodialysis patients)
Initial dose:
Child and adolescent: Start at 50 U/kg/dose 3 times per week. Reported dosage range for children 
(3 mo–20 yr) not requiring dialysis, 50–250 U/kg/dose 3 times per week. Reported dosage range 
for children receiving hemodialysis, 50–450 U/kg/dose 2–3 times per week.
Adult: Start at 50–100 U/kg/dose 3 times per week
Maintenance dose: Dose is individualized to achieve and maintain the lowest Hgb level sufficient to 
avoid transfusions and not to exceed 11 g/dL.
Anemia in cancer (use until chemotherapy is completed; see remarks for dosage reduction and 
withholding therapy):
Initial dose:
Child (5–18 yr): Start at 600 U/kg (max. dose: 40,000 U) IV once weekly.
Adult: Start at 150 U/kg/dose SC 3 times per week or 40,000 U SC once every week.
Increasing doses (if needed):
Three-­times-­a-­week dosing regimen (adult): If no increase in Hgb >1 g/dL and Hgb remains <10 
g/dL after initial 4 wk of therapy, increase dosage to 300 U/kg/dose 3 times per week.
Weekly dosing regimen: If no increase in Hgb >1 g/dL and Hgb remains <10 g/dL after initial 4 
wk of therapy:
Child: Increase dose to 900 U/kg/dose IV (max. dose: 60,000 U) once weekly.
Adult: 60,000 U SC once weekly.
For all ages, discontinue use after 8 wk of therapy if transfusions are still required or no hemoglobin 
response is observed.
AZT-treated HIV patients (Hgb should not exceed 12 g/dL): SC/IV
Child: Reported dosage range in children (≥3 mo–17 yr), 50–400 U/kg/dose 2–3 times per wk.
Adult (with serum erythropoietin ≤500 milliunits/mL and receiving ≤4200 mg AZT per week): Start 
at 100 U/kg/dose 3 times per wk ×8 wk. If response is NOT satisfactory in reducing transfusion 
requirements or increasing Hgb levels after 8 wk of therapy, dose may be increased by 50–100 U/
kg/dose given 3 times per wk and reevaluated every 4–8 wk thereafter. Patients are unlikely to 
respond to doses >300 U/kg/dose 3 times per wk.
For all ages, withhold therapy if Hgb >12 g/dL and resume therapy by decreasing dosage by 25% 
once Hgb falls below 11 g/dL. For adults, discontinue therapy if Hgb does not increase after 8 wk of 
the 300 U/kg/dose 3 times per wk dosage.
Anemia of prematurity (many regimens exist):
250 U/kg/dose SC 3 times per wk ×10 doses; alternatively, 200–400 U/kg/dose IV/SC 3–5 times per 
wk for 2–6 wk (total dose per wk is 600–1400 U/kg). Administer with supplemental iron at 3–6 mg 
elemental iron/kg/24 hr.
Use the lowest dose to avoid transfusions.

serious cardiovascular events, and thrombosis in various cancer patients, especially with Hgb levels 
>12 g/dL, have been reported with epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-­stimulating agents.
Evaluate serum iron, ferritin, TIBC before therapy. Iron supplementation recommended during therapy 
unless iron stores are already in excess. Monitor Hct, BP, clotting times, platelets, BUN, serum 
creatinine. Peak effect in 2–3 wk.
DOSAGE ADJUSTMENT FOR ANEMIA IN CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:
Reduce dose by ≥25%: when Hgb increases >1 g/dL in any 2-­wk period. Dose reductions can be 
made more frequently than once every 4 wk if needed.
Increase dose by 25%: when Hgb does not increase by 1 g/dL after 4 wk of therapy. Dosage incre­
ments should not be made more frequently than once every 4 wk.
Withholding therapy: when Hgb >11 g/dL; restart therapy at a 25% lower dose after Hgb 
decreases to target levels or <11 g/dL.
Inadequate response after a 12-­week dose escalation: Use minimum effective dosage that will 
maintain hemoglobin levels to avoid the need for recurrent blood transfusions and evaluate 
other causes of anemia. Discontinue use if patient remains transfusion dependent.
DOSAGE REDUCTION ADJUSTMENT/WITHHOLDING THERAPY FOR ANEMIA IN CANCER:
If Hgb exceeds a level needed to avoid blood transfusion: Withhold dose and resume therapy at a 
reduced dosage by 25% when Hgb approaches a level where blood transfusions may be needed.
If Hgb increases >1 g/dL in any 2-­wk period or Hgb reaches a level to avoid blood transfusion: 
Reduce dose by 25%.
May cause hypertension, seizure, hypersensitivity reactions, headache, edema, dizziness. SC route 
provides sustained serum levels compared to IV route. For IV administration, infuse over 1–3 min.
Do not use multi-­dose vial preparation for breastfeeding mothers because of concerns for benzyl

Contraindicated in heart failure caused by decreased left ventricular ejection fraction. Use with 
caution in bleeding disorders; inhibits platelet aggregation.
Dose-­dependent side effects of nausea, diarrhea, jaw pain, bone pain, and headaches are 
common. Other common side effects include hypotension, flushing, diarrhea, loss of appetite, 
and chest and musculoskeletal pain. Reported complications include sepsis, local site infection, 
and catheter dislodgement resulting in severe sepsis or rebound pulmonary hypertension (avoid 
abrupt dose withdrawal and monitor for IV line interruptions). Hypoxia, flushing, and tachycardia 
may suggest an overdose.
Use with medications exhibiting antiplatelet effects (e.g., SSRI antidepressants, desvenlafaxine, venlafax­
ine, duloxetine, NSAIDs, and anticoagulants) may increase risk for bleeding. May increase digoxin levels.
Systemic T1/2 is 2–5 min. Continuous IV infusion is administered via central venous catheter with

Hypoparathyroidism (with calcium supplementation):
Child: 50,000–200,000 IU/24 hr PO
Adult: 25,000–200,000 IU/24 hr PO
Consider using cholecalciferol instead; cholecalciferol has shown to be more biologically potent 
with better absorption than ergocalciferol. Vitamin D2 is activated by 25-­hydroxylation in liver 
and 1-­hydroxylation in kidney to the active form, calcitriol.
Monitor serum Ca{2+}, PO4, 25-­OH vitamin D (goal level for infant and child: ≥20 ng/mL), and alkaline 
phosphate. Serum Ca{2+}, PO4 product should be <70 mg/dL to avoid ectopic calcification. Titrate 
dosage to patient response. Watch for symptoms of hypercalcemia: weakness, diarrhea, polyuria, 
metastatic calcification, nephrocalcinosis.
Serum 25-­OH vitamin D level of ≥35 ng/mL has been suggested in cystic fibrosis patients to decrease 
the risk of hyperparathyroidism and bone loss.

ESCITALOPRAM
Lexapro and generics
Antidepressant, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
Tabs: 5, 10, 20 mg
Oral solution: 1 mg/mL (240 mL); contains parabens and propylene glycol
Depression:
<12 yr: Limited data, only one placebo-­controlled RCT did not demonstrate efficacy.
≥12 yr and adolescent: Start with 10 mg PO once daily. If needed after 3 wk, dose may be 
increased to 20 mg once daily.
Adult: Start with 10 mg PO once daily. If needed after 1 wk, dose may be increased to 20 mg once 
daily.
Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD; limited data)
6–17 yr: A 10-­wk open-­label trial in which 28 subjects were given a weekly PRN increasing PO 
dosage regimen of 2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg/24 hr. Mean dosage of responders with significant 
improvement at 11.1 ± 6.5 mg/24 hr. 25% of subjects responded at doses <10 mg/24 hr and 
36% responded at doses ≥ 10 mg/24 hr. Seven of the 17 (41%) responders and 25% of all treated 
subjects could not tolerate the 10-­mg/24 hr dose.
Social Anxiety Disorder (limited data):
10–17 yr: A 12-­wk open-­label trial in which 20 subjects were given an initial PO dosage of 5 mg 
once daily × 7 days followed by 10 mg once daily. If needed and tolerated, increase by 5 mg/24 hr 
at weekly intervals up to a maximum of 20 mg/24 hr. Two subjects did not complete the trial due 
to lack of efficacy and tolerability. Sixty-­five percent of the remaining subjects met the response 
criteria with a mean final dose of 13 ± 4.1 mg/24 hr. Common adverse events included somnolence 
(25%), insomnia (20%), flu symptoms (15%), increased appetite (15%), and decreased appetite 
(15%).
Increased risk for serotonin syndrome when used with MAO inhibitors (or within 14 days of 
discontinuance), linezolid, or methylene blue; concurrent use considered contraindicated. Do 
not use with pimozide because of risk for increased QTc interval. Use with caution with 
hepatic or severe renal impairment; dosage adjustment may be needed. Avoid abrupt 
discontinuation to prevent withdrawal symptoms.
Diaphoresis, GI discomfort, xerostomia, dizziness, headache, insomnia, somnolence, sexual dysfunction, 
and fatigue are common side effects. Abnormal bleeding, depression, QTc prolongation, and suicidal 
ideation have been reported.
Primarily metabolized by the CYP 450 2C19 and 3A4 enzymes and is a weak inhibitor for CYP 450 2D6 
enzyme. Consider an alternative medication (not significantly metabolized by CYP 450 2C19) for 
individuals with ultrarapid CYP 450 2C19 activity. Poor CYP450 2C19 metabolizers can either initiate 
therapy at 50% the usual dose and titrate to response or consider alternative therapy.
Taking with other medications with QTc prolongation may further increase that risk. Omeprazole may 
increase the toxicity of escitalopram. Doses may be administered with or without food.

Contraindicated in serious infections, sepsis, or hypersensitivity to any of medication components. 
Use with caution in patients with history of recurrent infections (including hepatitis B) or 
underlying conditions that may predispose them to infections (including concomitant 
immunosuppressive therapy), CNS demyelinating disorders, malignancies, immune-­related 
diseases, and latex allergy. Common adverse effects in children include headache, abdominal pain, 
vomiting, and nausea. Injection site reactions (e.g., discomfort, itching, swelling), rhinitis, 
dizziness, rash, depression, infections (varicella, aseptic meningitis, rare cases of TB, and fatal/
serious infections and sepsis), bone marrow suppression (e.g., aplastic anemia), sarcoidosis, 
vertigo, and CNS demyelinating disorder have also been reported. Malignancies (some fatal and 
∼50% were lymphomas) have been reported in children and adolescents.
Do not administer live vaccines concurrently with this drug. In JRA, it is recommended that before 
initiating therapy, the patient be brought up to date with all immunizations in agreement with cur­
rent immunization guidelines.
Onset of action is 1–4 wk, with peak effects usually within 3 mo.
Patients must be properly instructed on preparing and administering the medication (see specific 
product information). For multi-­dose vial, reconstitute vial by gently swirling its contents with the 
supplied diluent (do not shake or vigorously agitate), as some foaming will occur. Reconstituted 
solutions should be clear and colorless; unused portions must be stored in the refrigerator and used 
within 14 days. Do not store Auto Touch auto-injector device in the refrigerator.
Drug is administered subcutaneously by rotating injection sites (thigh, abdomen, or upper arm) with 
a max. single injection site dose of 25 mg. Administer new injections ≥1 inch from an old site and

Drug of choice for absence seizures. Use with caution in hepatic and renal disease. Ataxia, 
anorexia, drowsiness, sleep disturbances, rashes, and blood dyscrasias are rare idiosyncratic 
reactions. May cause lupus-­like syndrome; may increase frequency of grand mal seizures in 
patients with mixed-­type seizures. Serious dermatological reactions (e.g., Stevens Johnson 
and DRESS) has been reported. May increase risk of suicidal thoughts/behavior. Cases of 
birth defects have been reported; ethosuximide crosses the placenta.
Carbamazepine, phenytoin, primidone, phenobarbital, valproic acid, nevirapine, and ritonavir may 
decrease ethosuximide levels.
Therapeutic levels: 40–100 mg/L. T1/2 = 24–42 hr. Recommended serum sampling time at steady state: 
obtain trough level within 30 min prior to the next scheduled dose after 5–10 days of continuous 
dosing.
To minimize GI distress, may administer with food or milk. Abrupt withdrawal of drug may precipitate 
absence status.

Obtain serum levels of concurrent anticonvulsants. Monitor liver enzymes, bilirubin, CBC 
with differential, platelets at baseline, and every 1–2 wk. Doses should be decreased by 
50% in renally impaired patients.
When initiating adjunctive therapy (all ages), doses of other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are reduced 
by 20% to control plasma levels of concurrent phenytoin, valproic acid, phenobarbital, and 
carbamazepine. Further reductions of concomitant AED dosage may be necessary to minimize side 
effects caused by drug interactions.
When converting to monotherapy, reduce other AEDs by one-third at the start of felbamate therapy. 
Then after 2 wk and at the start of increasing the felbamate dosage, reduce other AEDs by an 
additional one-third. At wk 3, continue to reduce other AEDs as clinically indicated.
Carbamazepine levels may be decreased; however, phenytoin and valproic acid levels may be increased. 
Phenytoin and carbamazepine may increase felbamate clearance; valproic acid may decrease its clearance.

Transdermal (see remarks): Safety has not been established in children <2 yr and should be adminis­
tered in children ≥2 yr who are opioid tolerant. Use is contraindicated in acute or post­operative pain 
in opiate-­naïve patients.
Opioid-­tolerant child receiving at least 60 mg morphine equivalents/24 hr: Use 25 mCg/hr patch 
Q72 hr. Patch titration should not occur before 3 days of administration of the initial dose or more 
frequently than every 6 days thereafter.
See Chapter 6 for equianalgesic dosing and PCA dosing.
Intranasal route for acute and pre-­procedure analgesia (use IV dosage form; see remarks):
≥1 yr–adolescent: 1–2 mCg/kg/dose intranasally via an automizer (max. dose: 100 mCg/dose) 
Q1 hr PRN
Use with caution in bradycardia, respiratory depression, and increased intracranial pressure. 
Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31). Fatalities and life-­threatening respiratory 
depression have been reported with inappropriate use (overdoses, use in opioid-­naïve 
patients, changing the patch too frequently, and exposing the patch to a heat source) of 
the transdermal route.
Highly lipophilic and may deposit into fat tissue. IV onset of action 1–2 min with peak effects in 
10 min. IV duration of action 30–60 min. Give IV dose over 3–5 min. Rapid infusion may cause 
respiratory depression and chest wall rigidity. Respiratory depression may persist beyond the period 
of analgesia. Transdermal onset of action 6–8 hr with a 72-­hr duration of action. See Chapter 6 for 
pharmacodynamic information with transmucosal and transdermal routes.
Buccal tabs and oral lozenges are indicated only for the management of breakthrough cancer pain in 
patients who are already receiving and who are tolerant to opioid therapy. Buccal tabs (Fentora), 
transdermal patches (Duragesic), and lozenge (Actiq) dosage forms are available through a restricted 
distribution program (REMS) and are NOT bioequivalent (see package insert for conversion).
Intranasal route of administration for analgesia has an onset of action at 10–30 min. Pediatric stud­
ies has demonstrated that the intranasal fentanyl is equivalent to and better than morphine (PO/
IV/IM) and equivalent to intravenous fentanyl for providing analgesia.
Fentanyl is a substrate for the CYP 450 3A4 enzyme. Be aware of medications that inhibit or induce 
this enzyme, for it may increase or decrease the effects of fentanyl, respectively.
Pregnancy category changes to “D” if drug is used for prolonged periods or in high doses at term.

simultaneous administration with chemotherapy and radiation and do not administer 24 hr 
before or after administration of chemotherapy.
Safety and effectiveness have been established for nonmyeloid malignancies receiving myelosup­
pressive chemotherapy in children ≥1 mo–<17 yr old. The safety profile was similar to adults.
SC routes of administration are preferred because of prolonged serum levels over IV route. If used via 
IV route and G-­CSF final concentration <15 mCg/mL, add 2 mg albumin/1 mL of IV fluid to prevent 
drug adsorption to the IV administration set.

nausea, headache, rash, vomiting, abdominal pain, hepatitis, cholestasis, and diarrhea. 
Neutropenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, exfoliative skin disorders (e.g., SJS, TEN, 
DRESS), and adrenal insufficiency (reversible) have been reported. Use with caution in 
hepatic or renal dysfunction and in patients with hypokalemia, proarrhythmic conditions, 
or advanced cardiac failure.
Inhibits CYP 450 2C9/10 and CYP 450 3A3/4 (weak inhibitor). May increase effects, toxicity, or ­
levels of cyclosporine, midazolam, phenytoin, rifabutin, tacrolimus, theophylline, warfarin, oral 
hypoglycemics, and AZT. Rifampin increases fluconazole metabolism.
Consider using higher doses in morbidly obese patients. Adjust dose in renal failure (see ­
Chapter 31).
Pregnancy category is “C” for single 150 mg use for vaginal candidiasis, but a Danish study reports 
a higher risk for miscarriages for during weeks 7–22 of gestation. Pregnancy category “D” is

Dosages of 75–100 mg/kg/24 hr have been used in neonates (preterm and term) for candidal 
meningitis.
Child and adult (monitor serum concentrations): 50–150 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q6 hr PO
Monitor CBC, BUN, serum creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, AST, and ALT. Common side 
effects: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, CNS disturbance, anemia, leukopenia, and 
thrombocytopenia. Use with caution in hepatic and renal impairment and in hematologic 
disorders. Use is contraindicated in the first trimester of pregnancy.
Therapeutic levels: 25–100 mg/L. Recommended serum sampling time at steady ­state: Obtain peak 
level 2–4 hr after oral dose following 4 days of continuous dosing. Peak levels of 40–60 mg/L have 
been recommended for systemic candidiasis. Maintain trough levels above 25 mg/L. Prolonged 
levels above 100 mg/L can increase risk for bone marrow suppression. Bone marrow suppression in 
immunosuppressed patients can be irreversible and fatal.

Benzodiazepine overdose (IV, see remarks):
Child (limited data): 0.01 mg/kg (max. dose: 0.2 mg) Q1 min PRN to a max. total 
cumulative dose of 1 mg. As an alternative for repeat bolus doses, a continuous 
infusion of 0.005–0.01 mg/kg/hr have been used.
Adult: Initial dose: 0.2 mg over 30 sec, if needed, give 0.3 mg 30 sec later over 30 sec. Additional doses 
of 0.5 mg given over 30 sec Q1 min PRN up to a cumulative dose of 3 mg (usual cumulative dose: 1–3 
mg). Patients with only partial response to 3 mg may require additional slow titration to a total of 5 mg.
Reversal of benzodiazepine sedation (IV):
Child: Initial dose: 0.01 mg/kg (max dose: 0.2 mg) given over 15 sec, if needed after 45 sec, 0.01 
mg/kg (max. dose: 0.2 mg) Q1 min to a max. total cumulative dose of 0.05 mg/kg or 1 mg, 
whichever is lower. Usual total dose: 0.08–1 mg (average 0.65 mg).
Adult: Initial dose: 0.2 mg over 15 sec, if needed after 45 sec, give 0.2 mg Q1 min to a max. total 
cumulative dose of 1 mg. Doses may be repeated at 20 min interval (max. dose of 1 mg per 20 
min interval) up to a max. dose of 3 mg in 1 hr.
Does not reverse narcotics. Onset of benzodiazepine reversal occurs in 1–3 min. Reversal 
effects of flumazenil (T1/2 approximately 1 hr) may wear off sooner than benzodiazepine 
effects. If patient does not respond after cumulative 1–3 mg dose, suspect agent other 
than benzodiazepines.
May precipitate seizures, especially in patients taking benzodiazepines for seizure control or in 
patients with tricyclic antidepressant overdose. Fear and panic attacks in patients with history of 
panic disorders have been reported.
Use with caution in liver dysfunction; flumazenil’s clearance is significantly reduced. Use normal 
dose for initial dose and decrease the dosage and frequency for subsequent doses.

Bulimia:
Adolescent (PO; limited data): 20 mg QAM × 3 days, then 40 mg QAM × 3 days, then 60 mg QAM.
Adult: 60 mg QAM PO; it is recommended to titrate up to this dose over several days.
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder:
Adult: Start at 20 mg PO once daily continuously or intermittently (starting 14 days prior to the 
anticipated onset of menstruation through the first full day of menses and repeating with each new 
cycle) using the Sarafem product. Max. dose: 80 mg/24 hr. Systematic evaluation has shown that 
efficacy is maintained for periods of 6 mo at a dose of 20 mg/day. Reassess patients periodically to 
determine the need for continued treatment.
Contraindicated in patients taking MAO inhibitors (e.g., linezolid) due to possibility of seizures, 
hyperpyrexia, and coma. Use with caution in patients with angle-­closure glaucoma, receiving 
diuretics, or with liver (reduce dose with cirrhosis) or renal impairment. May increase the effects 
of tricyclic antidepressants. May cause headache, insomnia, nervousness, drowsiness, GI 
disturbance, and weight loss. Increased bleeding diathesis with unaltered prothrombin time may 
occur with warfarin. Hyponatremia has been reported. Monitor for clinical worsening of depression 
and suicidal ideation/behavior following the initiation of therapy or after dose changes.
May displace other highly protein-­bound drugs. Inhibits CYP 450 2C19, 2D6, and 3A3/4 drug metabo­
lism isoenzymes, which may increase the effects or toxicity of drugs metabolized by these enzymes. 
For example, use with pimozide or thioridazine may increase the risk for prolonged cardiac QTc 
interval and is considered contraindicated. Use with serotonergic drugs (e.g., triptans, methylene 
blue) and drugs that impair serotonin metabolism (MAOIs) may increase the risk for serotonin 
syndrome. Carefully review the patients’ medication profile for potential interactions.
Delayed-­release capsule is currently indicated for depression and is dosed at 90 mg Q7 days. It is 
unknown if weekly dosing provides the same protection from relapse as does daily dosing.
Breastfeeding is not recommended by the manufacturer, as adverse events to nursing infants have 
been reported. Fluoxetine and metabolite are variable and are higher when compared with other 
SSRIs. Maternal use of SSRIs during pregnancy and postpartum may result in more difficult breast­
feeding. Infants exposed to SSRIs during pregnancy may also have an increased risk for persistent 
pulmonary hypertension of the newborn.

FLUVOXAMINE
Generics; previously available as Luvox and Luvox CR
Antidepressant, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
Tabs: 25, 50, 100 mg
Extended-release capsules: 100, 150 mg
Obsessive compulsive disorder (use immediate-release tablets unless noted otherwise, see 
remarks):
8–17 yr: Start at 25 mg PO QHS. Dose may be increased by 25 mg/24 hr Q7–14 days 
(slower titration at Q2–4 wk may be used for minimizing behavioral side effects). 
Total daily doses >50 mg/24 hr should be divided BID. Female patients may require 
lower dosages compared to males.
Max. dose: Child: 8–11 yr: 200 mg/24 hr; and child ≥12–17 yr: 300 mg/24 hr
Adult: Start at 50 mg PO QHS. Dose may be increased by 50 mg/24 hr Q4–7 days up to a max. dose 
of 300 mg/24 hr. Total daily doses >100 mg/24 hr should be divided BID with larger dose at 
bedtime.
Extended-release capsule (adult): Start at 100 mg PO QHS. Dose may be increased by 
50 mg/24 hr Q7 days up to a max. dose of 300 mg/24 hr.
Contraindicated with coadministration of cisapride, pimozide, thioridazine, tizanidine, or 
MAO inhibitors. Use with caution in hepatic disease (dosage reduction may be necessary 
as drug is extensively metabolized by the liver) and in combination with serotonergic drugs 
(e.g., TCAs, triptans, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, amphetamines, tryptophan, and St. 
John’s Wort). Monitor for clinical worsening of depression and suicidal ideation/behavior 
following the initiation of therapy or after dose changes.
Major substrate for CYP 450 1A2 and 2D6. Poor metabolizers of CYP 450 2D6 should consider an 
initial dose reduction of 25%–50% and titrate to response or use an alternative medication not 
metabolized by this enzyme.
Inhibits CYP 450 1A2, 2C19, 2C9, 2D6, and 3A3/4, which may increase the effects or toxicity of 
drugs metabolized by these enzymes. Dose-­related use of thioridazine with fluvoxamine may cause 
prolongation of QT interval and serious arrhythmias. May increase warfarin plasma levels by 98% 
and prolong PT. May increase toxicity and/or levels of theophylline, caffeine, and tricyclic antide­
pressants. Side effects include: headache, insomnia, somnolence, nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia, 
and dry mouth.
Titrate to lowest effective dose. Use a gradual taper when discontinuing therapy to prevent with­
drawal symptoms.
Consider the benefits to potential risk for maternal use in breastfeeding. Maternal use during 
pregnancy and postpartum may result in breastfeeding difficulties.

Q12–24 hr.
Adult: 20–80 mg/dose Q6–12 hr; max. dose: 600 mg/24 hr
Continuous IV infusion:
Infant and child: 0.1 mg/kg IV bolus followed by 0.05–0.4 mg/kg/hr infusion and titrate to effect
Adult: 40–100 mg IV bolus followed by 10–40 mg/hr infusion and titrate to effect
Contraindicated in anuria and hepatic coma. Use with caution in hepatic disease (hepatic 
encephalopathy has been reported); cirrhotic patients may require higher than usual 
doses. Ototoxicity may occur in presence of renal disease (especially when used with 
aminoglycosides and other nephrotoxic drugs), with rapid IV injection (do not infuse >4 
mg/min in adults), or with hypoproteinemia. May cause hypokalemia, alkalosis, 
dehydration, hyperuricemia, and increased calcium excretion. Rash with eosinophilia and 
systemic symptoms and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis have been reported. 
Prolonged use in premature infants and in children <4 yr may result in nephrocalcinosis. 
May increase risk for PDA in premature infants during the first week of life.
Furosemide-­resistant edema in pediatric patients may benefit with the addition of 
metolazone. Some of these patients may have an exaggerated response leading to 
hypovolemia, tachycardia, and orthostatic hypotension requiring fluid replacement. Severe 
hypokalemia has been reported with a tendency for diuresis persisting for up to 24 hr after 
discontinuing metolazone, prolonged use of laxatives, or concomitant use of 
corticosteroids, ACTH, and large amounts of licorice.
High doses of furosemide may inhibit binding of thyroid hormones to carrier proteins and result in 
transient increase in free thyroid hormones followed by an overall decrease in total thyroid hormone 
levels.
Max. rate of intermittent IV dose: 0.5 mg/kg/min. For patients receiving ECMO, do not administer IV 
doses directly into the ECMO circuit as the medication is absorbed in the circuit, which may result 
in diminished effects and the need for higher doses.
Pregnancy category changes to “D” if used in pregnancy-­induced hypertension.

Contraindicated in insulinoma, pheochromocytoma, and history of hypersensitivity to 
glucagon and components. Drug product is genetically engineered and identical to 
human glucagon. High doses have a cardiac stimulatory effect and have been used 
with some success in β-­blocker and calcium channel blocker overdose. May cause 
nausea, vomiting, urticaria, and respiratory distress. Necrolytic migratory erythema 
(NME) has been reported with continuous IV infusion; assess benefit/risk for 
continued use.
Do not delay glucose infusion; dose for hypoglycemia is 2–4 mL/kg of dextrose 25%.
Glucagon may increase the effects/toxicity of warfarin. Indomethacin use may decrease the effects 
of glucagon.
Sufficient hepatic glycogen is necessary for effect; patients in states of starvation, with adrenal or 
chronic hypoglycemia, may not have adequate levels of glycogen. Onset of action: IM: 8–10 min; IV: 
1 min. Duration of action: IM: 12–27 min; IV: 9–17 min.

Drug is metabolized by CYP ­450 1A2, 2D6, and 3A3/4 isoenzymes. May also inhibit CYP 450 2D6 and 
3A3/4 isoenzymes. Serotonin-­specific reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine) may increase levels 
and effects of haloperidol. Carbamazepine and phenobarbital may decrease levels and effects of 
haloperidol. Monitor for encephalopathic syndrome when used in combination with lithium.
For poor metabolizers of CYP 450 2D6, consider a 50% reduction of initial dose and titrate to 
response, OR use an alternative medication not metabolized by this enzyme system.
Acutely aggravated patients may require doses as often as Q60 min. Decanoate salt is given every 
3–4 wk in doses that are 10–15 times the individual patient’s stabilized oral dose.

These laboratory measurements are best measured 4–6 hr after initiation or changes in infusion rate. 
Do not collect blood levels from the heparinized line or same extremity as site of heparin infusion. 
If unfractionated heparin anti-­Xa or aPTT levels are not available, a ratio of aPPT 1.5–2.5 times 
control value has been used in the past. Unfractionated heparin anti-­Xa level is NOT THE SAME as 
low molecular weight heparin anti-­Xa (used for monitoring low molecular weight heparin products 
such as enoxaparin).
Use with IV nitroglycerin may decrease the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) with subsequent 
rebound upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) and NSAIDs may increase 
heparin’s anticoagulant effects and bleeding risk.
Use preservative-­free heparin in neonates. Note: heparin flush doses may alter aPTT in small 
patients; consider using more dilute heparin in these cases.
Use actual body weight when dosing obese patients. Due to recent regulatory changes to the manu­
facturing process, heparin products may exhibit decreased potency.
Antidote: Protamine sulfate (1 mg per 100 U heparin in previous 4 hr). For low molecular weight 
heparin (LMWH), see Enoxaparin. 
HYALURONIDASE
Amphadase, Hylenex, and Vitrase
Antidote, extravasation
Injection:

L-­methionine, and 0.2 mg polysorbate 80 per 150 U
Vitrase: 200 U/mL (1.2 mL); ovine source containing lactose, preservative-­free
 Pharmacy can make a 15 U/mL dilution.
Extravasation:
Infant and child: Give 1 mL (150 U) by injecting 5 separate injections of 0.2 mL (30 U) at 
borders of extravasation site SC or intradermal using a 25-­ or 26-­gauge needle. Alternatively, 
a diluted 15 U/mL concentration has been used with the same dosing instructions.
Contraindicated in dopamine and alpha-­agonist extravasation and hypersensitivity to the 
respective product sources (bovine or ovine). May cause urticaria. Patients receiving large 
amounts of salicylates, cortisone, ACTH, estrogens, or antihistamines may decrease the 
effects of hyaluronidase (larger doses may be necessary). Administer as early as possible 
(minutes to 1 hr) after IV extravasation.

Chronic hypertension:
Infant and child: Start at 0.75–1 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ Q6–12 hr (max. initial dose: 10 mg/dose). If 
necessary, increase dose over 3–4 wk up to a max. dose of 5 mg/kg/24 hr for infants and 7.5 mg/
kg/24 hr for children; or 200 mg/24 hr.
Adult: 10–50 mg/dose PO QID; max. dose: 300 mg/24 hr
Use with caution in severe renal and cardiac disease. Slow acetylators, patients receiving 
high-­dose chronic therapy, and those with renal insufficiency are at highest risk of lupus-­
like syndrome (generally reversible). May cause reflex tachycardia, palpitations, dizziness, 
headaches, and GI discomfort. MAO inhibitors and beta-­blockers may increase hypotensive 
effects. Indomethacin may decrease hypotensive effects.
Drug undergoes first pass metabolism. Onset of action: PO: 20–30 min; IV: 5–20 min. Duration of

For IV use, give slowly over 30–60 min at a concentration ≤5 mg/mL to reduce risk for 
nausea (lowering the rate may reduce severity). Adverse effects: thrombophlebitis, pruritus, 
urticaria, GI symptoms, seizures, dizziness, hypotension, elevated LFTs, blood dyscrasias, 
and penicillin allergy. Greater risk for seizures may occur with CNS infections, concomitant 
use with ganciclovir, higher doses, and renal impairment. CSF penetration is variable but 
best with inflamed meninges. Not recommended in CNS infections for neonates due to 
cilastatin accumulation and seizure risk.
Do not administer with probenecid (increases imipenem/cilastatin levels) and ganciclovir (increased 
risk for seizures). May significantly reduce valproic acid levels.
Adjust dose in renal insufficiency (see Chapter 31).

Contraindicated in narrow-­angle glaucoma and patients who used MAO inhibitors within 14 days. 
See Chapter 3 for management of toxic ingestion. Monitor for clinical worsening of depression 
and suicidal ideation/behavior following the initiation of therapy or after dose changes. Use 
with caution in renal or hepatic impairment. Side effects include sedation, urinary retention, 
constipation, dry mouth, dizziness, drowsiness, and arrhythmia. QHS dosing during first weeks 
of therapy will reduce sedation. Monitor ECG, BP, CBC at start of therapy and with dose 
changes. Tricyclics may cause mania. False-­positive test for urine PCP screen may occur.
Therapeutic reference range for depression (sum of imipramine and desipramine) = 
150–250 ng/mL. Levels >1000 ng/mL are toxic; however, toxicity may occur at >300 ng/mL.
Recommended serum sampling times at steady-­state: Obtain trough level within 30 min prior to the 
next scheduled dose after 5–7 days of continuous therapy.
Imipramine is a major substrate for CYP 450 2C19 and 2D6. See the remarks in amitriptyline for 
pharmacogenomic dosing considerations. Carbamazepine may reduce imipramine levels, and 
cimetidine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, labetalol, quinidine may increase imipramine levels.
Onset of antidepressant effects: 1–3 wk. Do not discontinue abruptly in patients receiving long-­term 
high-­dose therapy.

Intramuscular (IM) preparations:
Measles, postexposure prophylaxis for high-­risk patients: 0.5 mL/kg/dose (max. dose: 15 mL) IM × 1 
within 6 days of exposure.
IM administration: Administer in the anterolateral aspects of the upper thigh or deltoid muscle of the 
upper arm. Avoid gluteal region due to risk of injury to sciatic nerve. Consider splitting doses for 
multiple injection sites to address age specific maximum IM injection volumes.
Use with caution in patients with increased risk of thrombosis (e.g., hypercoagulable states, 
prolonged immobilization, in-­dwelling catheters, estrogen use, thrombosis history, 
cardiovascular risks, and hyperviscosity) or hemolysis (e.g., non-­O blood type, associated 
inflammatory conditions, and receiving high cumulative doses of immune globulins over 
several days).
May cause flushing, chills, fever, headache, and hypotension. Hypersensitivity reaction may occur 
when IV form is administered rapidly. Maltose-­containing products may cause an osmotic diuresis. 
May cause anaphylaxis in lgA-­deficient patients due to varied amounts of lgA. Some products are 
lgA depleted; consult a pharmacist.
To decrease risk of renal dysfunction, including acute renal failure, IV preparations containing 
sucrose should not be infused at a rate such that the amount of sucrose exceeds 3 mg/kg/min.
SC route provides higher serum trough levels, lower rate of adverse reactions, and shorter administra­
tion time when compared with the IV route. Use of adjusted body weight [ABW = Ideal Body Weight + 
0.5 (Actual Body Weight − Ideal Body Weight] for dosing in obese patients has been recommended.
Delay immunizations after immune globulin administration (see latest AAP Red Book for details).

Use NOT recommended with drugs that lower seizure threshold (e.g., phenothiazines), amiodarone 
(increased risk of cardiotoxicity), and metformin (lactic acidosis and acute renal failure).
Many other uses exist, see package insert for additional information. Iohexol is particularly useful 
when barium sulfate is contraindicated in patients with suspected bowel perforation or those 
where aspiration of contrast medium is of concern. Oral dose is poorly absorbed from the 
normal GI tract (0.1%–0.5%); absorption increases with bowel perforation or bowel obstruction. 
Concentrations 302–755 mg iohexol/mL have osmolalities from 1.1 to 3 times that of plasma (285

≥12 yr: 8 sprays Q20 min × 3
Contraindicated in atropine hypersensitivity. Use with caution in narrow-­angle glaucoma or 
bladder neck obstruction, though ipratropium has fewer anticholinergic systemic effects 
than atropine. May cause anxiety, dizziness, headache, GI discomfort, and cough with 
inhaler or nebulized use. Epistaxis, nasal congestion, and dry mouth/throat have been 
reported with the nasal spray. Reversible anisocoria may occur with unintentional 
aerosolization of drug to the eyes, particularly with mask nebulizers. Proven efficacy of 
nebulized solution in pediatrics is currently limited to reactive airway disease management 
in the emergency room and intensive care unit areas.
Current aerosol inhaler product does not contain soy products. Combination ipratropium and 
albuterol products are currently approved for use only in adults and has not been formally studied 
in children. See albuterol for additional remarks if using the combination product.
Bronchodilation onset of action is 1–3 min with peak effects within 1.5–2 hr and duration of action 
of 4–6 hr.
Shake inhaler well prior to use with spacer. Nebulized solution may be mixed with albuterol (or use 
the combination product).
Pregnancy category is “C” for Combivent Respimat. Breastfeeding safety extrapolated from safety 
of atropine.

FERRIC GLUCONATE (IV):
Iron deficiency anemia in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis who are receiving 
supplemental erythropoietin therapy (most require 8 doses at 8 sequential dialysis 
treatments to achieve a favorable response):
Child ≥6 yr: 1.5 mg/kg elemental Fe (0.12 mL/kg) IV; max. dose: 125 mg elemental Fe/dose. Dilute 
dose in 25 mL NS and infuse over 1 hr.
Adult: 125 mg elemental Fe in 100 mL NS IV; infuse over 1 hr. Most require a minimum cumulative 
dose of 1 g elemental Fe administered over 8 sessions.
IRON DEXTRAN (IV or IM):
Iron deficiency anemia (≥4 mo, child, adolescent):
Test dose (IV over 5 min or IM; may initiate treatment dose 1 hr after test dose):
<10 kg: 10 mg
10–20 kg: 15 mg
≥20 kg: 25 mg
Total replacement dose of iron dextran (mL) = 0.0476 × lean body wt (kg) × (desired Hb [g/dL] − 
measured Hb [g/dL]) + 1 mL per 5 kg lean body weight (up to max. of 14 mL). Total replacement 
dose is divided into smaller daily doses if exceeds respective IV or IM daily max. doses (see below).
Acute blood loss: Total replacement dose of iron dextran (mL) = 0.02 × blood loss (mL) × hematocrit 
expressed as decimal fraction. Assumes 1 mL of RBC = 1 mg elemental iron.
If no reaction to test dose, give remainder of replacement dose ÷ over 2–3 daily doses.
Max. daily IV dose: 100 mg
Max. daily IM dose:
<5 kg: 0.5 mL (25 mg)
5–10 kg: 1 mL (50 mg)
>10 kg: 2 mL (100 mg)
IM administration: use “Z-­track” technique.
IV administration: Dilute in NS at a max. concentration of 50 mg/mL and infuse over 1–6 hr at a 
max. rate of 50 mg/min.
IRON SUCROSE (IV):
Test dose (optional): Infuse 25% of first day dose up to a max. of 25 mg undiluted over 30 min.
Iron deficiency anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease:
Child:
ESRD on hemodialysis: (limited data from 14 children): 1 mg/kg/dialysis was adequate for 
correcting ferritin levels and 0.3 mg/kg/dialysis was successful in maintaining ferritin levels 
between 193 and 250 mCg/L. Doses were administered during the last hr of each dialysis and 
are recommended at a frequency of 3 times a week. A 10 mg test dose was administered.
Non-­renal iron deficiency, refractory to PO therapy (limited data): Calculate total iron 
replacement dose (mg) = 0.6 × wt (kg) × (100 − [measured Hb ÷ desired Hb × 100]). 
Replacement dose is administered by giving an initial dose of 5–7 mg/kg (max. dose: 100 
mg/24 hr) followed by a maintenance dose of 5–7 mg/kg/dose (max. dose: 300 mg/24 hr) 
Q3–7 days until total iron replacement dose is achieved.
Adult:
Hemodialysis-­dependent: 100 mg elemental Fe 1–3 times a wk during dialysis up to a total 
cumulative dose of 1000 mg. May continue to administer at lowest dose to maintain target 
Hb, Hct, and iron levels.
Nonhemodialysis-­dependent: 200 mg elemental Fe on 5 different days over a 2 wk period (total 
cumulative dose: 1000 mg).
IV administration: May administer undiluted over 2–5 min. For an infusion, dilute each 100 mg with 
a max. of 100 mL NS and infuse over at least 15 min.

Oral therapy with iron salts is preferred, injectable routes are painful. Gluconate and sucrose 
salts may be better tolerated than iron dextran. Adverse effects include hypotension, GI 
disturbances, fever, rash, myalgia, arthralgias, cramps, and headaches. Hypersensitivity 
reactions have been reported for iron dextran and sucrose products; use of test dose prior 
to first therapeutic dose is recommended.
IM administration is only possible with iron dextran salt. Follow infusion recommendations for 
specific product. Monitor vital signs during IV infusion. TIBC levels may not be meaningful within 
3 wk after dosing.
Efficacy and safety of iron sucrose for maintenance therapy has been evaluated in children 2 yr 
and older with CKD and receiving erythropoietin therapy. Common side effects include headache, 
respiratory tract viral infection, peritonitis, vomiting, pyrexia, dizziness, and cough.

Oral solution and capsule dosage form should NOT be used interchangeably; oral solution is 
more bioavailable. Only the oral solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or 
esophageal candidiasis. Contraindicated in CHF and certain interacting drugs (see below). 
Use with caution in hepatic and/or renal impairment, cardiac dysrhythmias, and azole 
hypersensitivity. May cause GI symptoms, headaches, rash, liver enzyme elevation, 
hepatitis, and hypokalemia. Double/blurred vision, dizziness, and tremor have been 
reported.
Like ketoconazole, it inhibits the activity of the CYP-­450 3A4 drug metabolizing isoenzyme. Thus, the 
coadministration of cisapride, dofetilide, felodipine, methadone, nisoldipine, pimozide, quinidine, 
triazolam, lovastatin, simvastatin, ergot derivatives, and oral midazolam is contraindicated. May 
increase systemic hormone concentrations of oral contraceptives. See remarks in Ketoconazole for 
additional drug interaction information.
Steady-­state serum concentrations of >0.25 mg/L itraconazole and >1 mg/L hydroxyitraconazole 
(metabolite) have been recommended. Recommended serum sampling time at steady state: any 
time after 2 wk after continuous dosing. Itraconazole has a 34–42-­hour T1/2.
Administer oral solution on an empty stomach but administer capsules with food. Oral capsule 
bioavailability has been shown to be reduced in immunocompromised patients. Achlorhydria 
reduces absorption of the drug. Do not use oral liquid dosage form in patients with GFR <30 mL/
min because of hydroxypropyl-­β-­cyclodextrin excipient has reduced clearance with renal failure.

Topical use:
Lotion:
Head lice infestation (≥6 mo to adult): Apply lotion to dry hair in sufficient amounts (up to one full 
tube) to thoroughly coat the hair and scalp for 10 min. Then rinse off with water.
Cream:
Rosacea (Adult): Apply cream to each affected area once daily.
Systemic Use: Rare fatal encephalopathy may occur in onchocerciasis with a concurrent 
heavy Loa loa infection. Reactions experienced with strongyloidiasis include diarrhea, 
nausea, vomiting, pruritus, rash, dizziness, and drowsiness. Adverse reactions experienced 
in onchocerciasis include cutaneous or systemic allergic/inflammatory reactions of varying 
severity (Mazzotti reaction) and ophthalmologic reactions. Specific reactions may include 
arthralgia/synovitis, lymph node enlargement and tenderness, pruritus, edema, fever, 
orthostatic hypotension, and tachycardia. Therapy for postural hypotension may include 
oral hydration, recumbency, IV normal saline, and/or IV steroids. Antihistamines or aspirin, 
or both, have been used for most mild-­to-­moderate cases. Ivermectin may increase the 
effects/toxicity of warfarin. Administer oral doses on an empty stomach with water.
Topical Use: Safety and efficacy have not been established for children <6 mo. Common side effects 
include conjunctivitis, ocular hyperemia, eye irritation, dandruff, dry skin, and skin-­burning. 
Contact dermatitis has been reported. Not for oral, ophthalmic, or intravaginal use. Use of lotion 
for children should be supervised by an adult to prevent oral ingestion.

aAlternative initial dosage (under medical supervision due to increased risk for CNS side effects): 200 mg × 1 and start 
12 hr later, 100 mg BID × 7 days then titrate to the respective monotherapy or adjunctive therapy goal.
Converting from other single antiepileptic drug (AED) to lacosamide monotherapy: administer lacos­
amide in combination with the established single AED for at least 3 days before tapering. Gradually 
withdrawing the concomitant AED over 6 wk is recommended.
IV use: Use same dose when converting from PO to IV and vice versa. IV use should be considered for 
short-­term use and has not been studied in pediatrics.
Use with caution with known cardiac conduction problems (e.g., second-­degree AV block), 
severe cardiac disease (e.g., MI or heart failure), concomitant use with drugs known to 
prolong PR interval, and renal (see Chapter 31) and hepatic impairment. Lacosamide 
undergoes 95% renal excretion; a reduction of 25% of the maximum dosage is 
recommended for adult and pediatric patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/
min and ESRD), or with mild/moderate hepatic impairment. Use is not recommended in 
severe hepatic impairment. Dose reduction may be also necessary with concurrent strong 
inhibitor of CYP 450 3A4 or 2C9 medication. Patients with mild/moderate hepatic 
impairment should be observed closely during dose titration. Oral bioavailability is 
approximately 100%.
Most common side effects in adults include diplopia, headache, dizziness, and nausea. 
Somnolence and irritability were frequently reported in pediatric studies. Patients should 
be advised of potential dizziness, ataxia, and syncope with use. Multiorgan hypersensitiv­
ity reactions (including DRESS, affecting the skin, kidney and liver), worsening of seizures, 
agranulocytosis, and euphoria (high doses) have been reported. As with other AEDs, monitor for 
suicidal behavior and ideation.
Oral doses may be administered with or without food. Swallow tablets whole; do not cut tablets. IV 
doses should be administered over 30–60 min. Do not abruptly withdraw therapy; gradually taper 
to prevent potential seizures.

Enzyme-­inducing AEDs include carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital. Stevens-­
Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and other potentially life-­threatening rashes 
have been reported in children (0.3%–0.8%) and adults (0.08%–0.3%) for adjunctive 
therapy in seizures. Reported rates for adults treated for bipolar/mood disorders as 
monotherapy and adjunctive therapy are 0.08% and 0.13%, respectively. May cause 
fatigue, drowsiness, ataxia, rash (especially with valproic acid), headache, nausea, 
vomiting, and abdominal pain. Diplopia, nystagmus, aseptic meningitis, hemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis, aggression, and alopecia have also been reported. False-­positive test 
for urine phencyclidine (PCP) screen may occur.
Use during the first 3 mo of pregnancy may result in a higher chance for cleft lip or cleft palate in the 
newborn. Suicidal behavior or ideation have been reported.
If converting from immediate-­release to extended-­release dosage form, initial dose of extended-­
release should match the total daily dose of the immediate-­release dosage and be administered 
once daily. Adjust dose as needed with the recommended dosage guidelines.
Reduce maintenance dose in renal failure. Reduce all doses (initial, escalation, and maintenance) in 
liver dysfunction defined by the Child-­Pugh grading system as follows:
Grade B: moderate dysfunction, decrease dose by ∼50%
Grade C: severe dysfunction, decrease dose by ∼75%
Withdrawal symptoms may occur if discontinued suddenly. A stepwise dose reduction 
over ≥2 wk (∼50% per week) is recommended unless safety concerns require a more 
rapid withdrawal.
Lamotrigine is metabolized by uridine 5′-­ diphospho-­glucuronyl transferases (UGT). Strong 
and moderate inducers of CYP 450 3A4 are known to induce UGT to increase lamotrigine 
clearance. Acetaminophen, carbamazepine, oral contraceptives (ethinylestradiol), pheno­
barbital, primidone, phenytoin, and rifampin may decrease levels of lamotrigine. Valproic 
acid may increase levels. False positive urine drug screen for phencyclidine (PCP) has been 
reported.
Safety and efficacy for maintenance therapy for bipolar disorder in 10–17 yr olds were not established 
in a RCT in 301 subjects.

Hypersecretory conditions: 60 mg PO once daily; dosage may be increased up to 90 mg PO BID, 
where doses >120 mg/24 hr are divided BID.
Common side effects include GI discomfort, headache, fatigue, rash, and taste perversion. 
Hypersensitivity reactions may result in anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchospasm, 
interstitial nephritis, and urticaria. Prolonged use may result in vitamin B{12} deficiency 
(≥2 yr) or hypomagnesemia (>1 yr). Microscopic colitis resulting in watery diarrhea has 
been reported, and switching to an alternative proton-­pump inhibitor may be beneficial in 
resolving diarrhea. Increased risk for fundic gland polys has been associated with long-­
term use >1 yr.
Drug is a substrate for CYP 450 2C19 and 3A3/4. Ultrarapid metabolizers of CYP 450 2C19 may 
experience reduced efficacy and may require a 4-­fold higher dosage. Lansoprazole may decrease 
levels of itraconazole, ketoconazole, iron salts, mycophenolate, nelfinavir, and ampicillin esters; 
and increase the levels/effects of methotrexate, tacrolimus and warfarin. Theophylline clearance 
may be enhanced. Reduce dose in severe hepatic impairment. May be used in combination with 
clarithromycin and amoxicillin for H. pylori infections.
A multicenter, double blind, parallel-­group study in infants (1 mo–1 yr) with GERD was no more 
effective than placebo.
Administer all oral doses before meals and 30 min prior to sucralfate. Do not crush or chew the 
granules (all dosage forms). Capsule may be opened and intact granules may be administered 
in an acidic beverage or food (e.g., apple or cranberry juice, apple sauce). Do not break or cut 
the orally disintegrating tablets. Use of oral disintegrating tablets dissolved in water has been 
reported to clog and block oral syringes and feeding tubes (gastric and jejunostomy). For IV use, 
use a 1.2 micron in-­line filter.

Refractory status epilepticus: (limited data):
Infant, child, and adolescent: 20 mg/kg (max. dose: 1500 mg/dose) IV over 15 min × 1, then start 
maintenance therapy based on clinical response and seizure type.
Do not abruptly withdraw therapy, to reduce risk for seizures. Use with caution in renal 
impairment (reduce dose; see Chapter 31) , hemodialysis, and neuropsychiatric 
conditions.
May cause loss of appetite, vomiting, dizziness, headaches, somnolence, agitation, depression, and 
mood swings. Drowsiness, fatigue, nervousness, and aggressive behavior have been reported in 
children. Nonpsychotic behavioral symptoms reported in children are approximately 3 times greater 
than in adults (37.6% vs. 13.3%). Suicidal behavior or ideation, serious dermatological reactions 
(e.g., Stevens Johnson and TEN), hematologic abnormalities (e.g., anemia, leukopenia), hyponatre­
mia, and hypertension have been reported. Levetiracetam may decrease carbamazepine’s effects. 
Ginkgo may decrease levetiracetam’s effects.
Drug has excellent PO absorption. For IV use, use similar immediate-­release PO dosages only when 
the oral route of administration is not feasible. Extended-­release tablet is designed for once-­daily 
administration at similar daily dosage of the immediate-­release forms (e.g., 1000 mg once daily 
of the extended release tablet is equivalent to 500 mg BID of the immediate release tablet). 
Disintegrating tabs (Spritam) may be administered by allowing the tablet to disintegrate in the 
mouth when taken with a sip of liquid or made into a suspension (see package insert); do not 
swallow this dosage form whole.

CYP 450 2D6 and 3A3/4 substrate. Use with caution in severe liver or renal disease. Decrease dose 
in hepatic failure or decreased cardiac output. Do not use topically for teething. Prolonged infusion 
may result in toxic accumulation of lidocaine, especially in infants. Do not use epinephrine-­
containing solutions for treatment of arrhythmias.
Therapeutic levels 1.5–5 mg/L. Toxicity occurs at >7 mg/L. Toxicity in neonates may occur at >5 mg/L 
due to reduced protein binding of drug. Elimination T1/2: premature infant: 3.2 hr, adult: 1.5–2 hr.
When using the topical patch, avoid exposing the application site to external heat sources as this 
may increase the risk for toxicity.

Should not be used in neonates <37 wk of gestation or in infants <12 mo old receiving 
treatment with methoglobin-­inducing agents (e.g., sulfa drugs, acetaminophen, 
nitrofurantoin, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, phenobarbital, phenytoin). Use with caution in 
patients with G6PD deficiency, patients treated with class I or III anti-­arrhythmic drugs 
(additive or toxic cardiac effects), and in patients with renal and hepatic impairment. 
Prilocaine has been associated with methemoglobinemia. Long duration of application, large 
treatment area, small patients, or impaired elimination may result in high blood levels.
Apply topically to intact skin and cover with occlusive dressing; avoid mucous membranes or the 
eyes. Wipe cream off before procedure. 
LINDANE
Gamma benzene hexachloride, and various generics
Scabicidal agent, pediculocide
Shampoo: 1% (60 mL)
Lotion: 1% (60 mL)
Child and adult (see remarks):
Scabies: Apply thin layer of lotion to skin from the neck to toes. Most patients will require 
30 mL and larger patient may require the maximum dose of 60 mL. Bathe and rinse off 
medication in adults after 8–12 hr; children 6–8 hr. Do not re-­treat.
Pediculosis capitis: Apply ≤30 mL (amount depends on length and density of hair; max. dose: 60 
mL) shampoo to dry hair without adding water. Work shampoo thoroughly into hair and allow to 
remain in place for 4 min. Then add small amounts of water to the hair until a good lather forms. 
Immediately rinse all the lather away and avoid contact of lather to other body surfaces. Towel dry 
and comb hair with fine-­tooth comb to remove nits. Do not re-­treat.
Pediculosis pubis: May use lotion or shampoo (applied locally) as for scabies and pediculosis capitis 
(see above).
Contraindicated in premature infants and seizure disorders. Use with caution with drugs 
that lower seizure threshold. Systemically absorbed. Risk of toxic effects is greater in 
young children; use other agents (permethrin) in infants, young children (<2 yr), and 
during pregnancy. Lindane is considered second-­line therapy owing to side-­effect risk and 
reports of resistance.
May cause a rash; rarely may cause seizures or aplastic anemia. For scabies, change clothing and bed 
sheets after starting treatment and treat family members. For pediculosis pubis, treat sexual contacts.
Avoid contact with face, urethral meatus, damaged skin, or mucous membranes. Do not use any 
covering that does not breathe (e.g., plastic lining or clothing) over the applied lindane.

Lisdexamfetamine is a pro-­drug of dextroamphetamine which requires activation by 
intestinal/hepatic metabolism.
Contraindicated in amphetamine or sympathomimetic hypersensitivity, symptomatic 
cardiovascular disease, moderate/severe hypertension, hyperthyroidism, glaucoma, agitated 
states, drug/alcohol abuse history, and MAO inhibitors (concurrent or use within 14 days). As 
with other CNS simulant medications, serious cardiovascular events, including death, have 
been reported in patients with preexisting structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious 
heart problems. Use with caution in patients with hypertension, psychiatric conditions, and 
epilepsy. May cause insomnia, irritability, rash, appetite suppression/weight loss, dizziness, 
xerostomia, and GI disturbances. Dermatillomania, bruxism, Stevens-­Johnson syndrome, and 
TEN have been reported.
Urinary acidifying agents may reduce levels of amphetamines and urinary alkalinizing agent 
may increase levels. May increase the effects of TCAs; increase or decrease the effects 
of guanfacine and phenytoin, and phenobarbital; and decrease the effects of adrenergic 
blockers, antihistamines, and antihypertensives. Norepinephrine may increase the effects of 
amphetamines.

898    Part IV  Formulary
Use lower initial dose (50% of recommended dose) if using with a diuretic or with the 
presence of hyponatremia, hypovolemia, severe CHF, or decreased renal function.
Contraindicated in hypersensitivity and history of angioedema with other ACE inhibitors, and 
in combination with a neprilysin inhibitor (e.g., sacubitril). Do not use with aliskiren in patients 
with diabetes. Avoid use with dialysis with high-­flux membranes because anaphylactoid reactions 
have been reported. Use with caution in aortic or bilateral renal artery stenosis, and hepatic 
impairment. Side effects include cough, dizziness, headache, hyperkalemia, hypotension (espe­
cially with concurrent diuretic or antihypertensive agent use), rash, and GI disturbances. Mood 
alterations, including depressive symptoms, have been reported.
Dual blockade of the renin-­angiotensin system with lisinopril and angiotensin receptor antagonists 
(e.g., losartin) or aliskiren is associated with increased risk for hypotension, syncope, hyperkale­
mia, and renal impairment. Diabetic patients on lisinopril treated with oral antidiabetic agents 
should be monitored for hypoglycemia, especially during the first month of use. NSAIDs (e.g., indo­
methacin) may decrease linsinopril’s effects. Use with mTOR inhibitors (e.g., sirolimus, everolimus) 
may increase risk for angioedema. Adjust dose in renal impairment (see Chapter 31).
Onset of action: 1 hr with maximal effect in 6–8 hr. Long-­term blood pressure monitoring is recom­
mended at Q2–4 wk until good control is achieved, followed by Q3–4 mo.
Additional indications with limited data in children include proteinuria associated with mild IgA 
nephropathy, and renal protection for diabetes or renal parenchymal disease.
Lisinopril should be discontinued as soon as possible when pregnancy is detected.

Infant and child: 0.05 mg/kg/dose Q4–8 hr PO/IV; max. dose: 2 mg/dose
May also give IM for preprocedure sedation.
Adult: 1–10 mg/24 hr PO ÷ BID–TID
Contraindicated in narrow-­angle glaucoma and severe hypotension. Use with caution in 
renal insufficiency (glucoronide metabolite clearance is reduced), hepatic insufficiency 
(may worsen hepatic encephalopathy; decrease dose with severe hepatic impairment), 
compromised pulmonary function, and use of CNS depressant medications. May cause 
respiratory depression, especially in combination with opioids and other sedatives. May 
also cause sedation, dizziness, mild ataxia, mood changes, rash, and GI symptoms. 
Paradoxical excitation has been reported in children (10%–30% of patients <8 yr old).
When compared to diazepam for status epilepticus (3 mo–17 yr), lorazepam was found to be more 
sedating with a longer time to return to baseline mental status.
Significant respiratory depression and/or hypotension has been reported when used in combination 
with loxapine. Probenecid and valproic acid may increase the effects/toxicity of lorazepam and oral 
contraceptive steroids may decrease lorazepam’s effects.
Injectable product may be given rectally. Benzyl alcohol and propylene glycol may be toxic to new­
borns at higher doses.

patient receiving diuretics, experiencing intravascular volume depletion, or has hepatic impair­
ment). Usual maintenance dose is 25–100 mg/24 hr PO ÷ once daily–BID
Use with caution in angioedema (current or past), excessive hypotension (volume depletion), 
hepatic (use lower starting dose) or renal (contains potassium) impairment, hyperkalemia 
(including use with medications that can cause hyperkalemia), renal artery stenosis and 
severe CHF. Not recommended in patients <6 yr or in children with GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 
m2, owing to lack of data.
Discontinue use as soon as possible when pregnancy is detected because injury and death to devel­
oping fetus may occur. Pregnancy category is “C” during the first trimester but changes to “D” for 
the second and third trimesters.
Diarrhea, asthenia, dizziness, fatigue, and hypotension are common. Thrombocytopenia, rhabdomy­
olysis, hallucinations, and angioedema have been rarely reported.
Losartan is a substrate for CYP 450 2C9 (major) and 3A4. Fluconazole and cimetidine may increase 
losartan effects/toxicity. Rifampin, phenobarbital, and indomethacin may decrease its effects. 
Losartan may increase the risk of lithium toxicity. Do not use with aliskiren in patients with dia­
betes or with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min). Dual blockade of the renin-­angiotensin system 
with losartin and ACE inhibitors (e.g., captopril) or aliskiren is associated with increased risk for

aor less frequently as studies have not been conducted in severe hepatic impairment.
Dosage modification when used with CYP 450 3A inhibitors:
Already taking Orkambi and initiating a strong CYP 450 3A inhibitor (e.g., itraconazole): no 
dosage adjustment
Already taking a strong CYP 450 3A inhibitor and initiating Orkambi: Reduce Orkambi dosage to 
1 tablet or 1 packet of granules every other day × the first week followed by the recommended 
daily dose. If Orkambi is interrupted for >1 wk and re-­initiated while taking strong CYP 450 3A 
inhibitors, Orkambi should be reintroduced with the reduced dosage of 1 tablet or 1 packet of 
granules every other day × 1 wk followed by the recommended daily dose.
Works on CFTR trafficking defect by acting as a CFTR corrector (lumecaftor) and in 
combination with a CFTR potentiator (ivacaftor). Indicated for individuals with homozygous 
F508del CFTR mutation.
Respiratory events, such as chest discomfort, dyspnea and abnormal respiration, may occur dur­
ing the initiation of therapy and may vary from transient to severe (requiring discontinuation). 
Common side effects include rash, diarrhea, nausea, flatulence, fatigue, nasal discharge, and 
URIs. Increased liver enzymes and cataracts may occur; monitor AST/ALT and ocular exam at 
baseline. Repeat AST/ALT every 3 mo for the first year followed by annual assessments. Repeat 
ocular exams annually. Hypertension has been reported. May cause a false positive urine drug 
screen for cannabinoids.
Use with caution with CrCl ≤30 mL/min and ESRD. Reduce dose with moderate/severe hepatic 
impairment (see dosage section) or when initiating therapy while taking a strong CYP 450 3A4 
inhibitor.
Lumecaftor is a strong inducer of CYP 450 3A and ivacaftor is a CYP 450 3A substrate; see dose 
modification table in the dosing section. Use with strong CYP 450 3A inducers (e.g., rifampin, 
rifabutin, carbamazepine, St. John’s wort) are not recommended. Lumecaftor/ivacaftor may reduce 
the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives and increase the incidence of menstruation-­associated 
side effects (e.g., amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, and irregular menses). Always evaluate potential 
drug-­drug interactions; see https://www.orkambihcp.com/drug-­interactionsddi–tool. Avoid food or 
drink containing grapefruit or Seville oranges.
Administer all doses with high-­fat foods to assure absorption. Oral granules can be mixed with 5 mL 
of soft foods or liquids such as puréed fruits or vegetables, yogurt, applesauce, water, breast milk, 
infant formula, milk, or juice. Once mixed, it should be consumed within an hour. If a dose (all 
dosage forms) is missed within 6 hr of a scheduled dose, administer a dose immediately. However, 
if the missed dose is >6 hr, skip that dose and resume therapy at the next scheduled dose. Never 
take a double dose for a missed dose.

Contraindicated in active or recent history of depression, anxiety disorders, psychosis or 
schizophrenia, seizures, or hypersensitivity to quinine or quinidine. Use with caution in 
cardiac dysrhythmias and neurologic disease. May cause dizziness, ringing of the ears, 
headache, syncope, psychiatric symptoms (e.g., anxiety, paranoia, depression, 
hallucinations, and psychotic behavior), seizures, ocular abnormalities, GI symptoms, 
leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. If neurologic or psychiatric side effects occur, 
discontinue therapy and use an alternative medication. Most adverse events occur within 3 
doses with prophylaxis use. Monitor liver enzymes and ocular exams for therapies >1 yr.
Mefloquine is a substrate and inhibitor of P-­glycoprotein and may reduce valproic acid levels. 
ECG abnormalities may occur when used in combination with quinine, quinidine, chloroquine, 
halofantrine, and β-­blockers. If any of the aforementioned antimalarial drugs is used in the 
initial treatment of severe malaria, initiate mefloquine at least 12 hr after the last dose of any 
of these drugs. Do not initiate halofantrine or ketoconazole within 15 days of the last dose 
of mefloquine. Use with chloroquine may increase risk for seizures. Rifampin may decrease 
mefloquine levels.
Do not take on an empty stomach. Administer with at least 240 mL (8 oz) water. Treatment failures 
in children may be related to vomiting of administered dose. If vomiting occurs less than 30 
min after the dose, administer a second full dose. If vomiting occurs 30–60 min after the dose, 
administer an additional half-­dose. If vomiting continues, monitor patient closely and consider 
alternative therapy.

Assess patient’s eGFR prior to initiating therapy. Contraindicated in severe renal impairment 
(<30 mL/min/1.73 m2), hepatic impairment (increased risk for lactic acidosis), CHF, and 
metabolic acidosis and during radiology studies using iodinated contrast media. Use with 
caution when transferring patients from chlorpropamide therapy (potential hypoglycemia 
risk), excessive alcohol intake, hypoxemia, dehydration, surgical procedures, mild/moderate 
renal impairment, hepatic disease, anemia, and thyroid disease.
Fatal lactic acidosis (diarrhea; severe muscle pain, cramping; shallow and fast breathing; unusual 
weakness and sleepiness) and decrease in vitamin B12 levels have been reported. May cause GI 
discomfort (∼50% incidence), anorexia, and vomiting. Transient abdominal discomfort or diar­
rhea have been reported in 40% of pediatric patients. Organic cationic transporter-­2 (OCT2)and 
multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE)inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine), furosemide, and nifedipine may 
increase the effects/toxicity of metformin. In addition to monitoring serum glucose and glycosyl­
ated hemoglobin, monitor renal function and hematologic parameters (baseline and annual).
Adult patients initiated on 500 mg PO BID may also have their dose increased to 850 mg PO BID after 
2 wk.
COMBINATION THERAPY WITH SULFONYLUREAS: If patient has not responded to 4 wk of maximum 
doses of metformin monotherapy, consider gradual addition of an oral sulfonylurea with continued 
maximum metformin dosing (even if failure with sulfonylurea has occurred). Attempt to identify the 
minimum effective dosage for each drug (metformin and sulfonylurea) because the combination 
can increase risk for sulfonylurea-­induced hypoglycemia. If patient does not respond to 1–3 mo of 
combination therapy with maximum metformin doses, consider discontinuing combination therapy 
and initiating insulin therapy.
Administer all doses with food.

Analgesia (see remarks):
Child: 0.7 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q4–6 hr PO, SC, IM, or IV PRN pain; max. dose: 10 mg/dose.
Adult: 2.5–10 mg/dose Q3–4 hr PO, SC, IM, or IV PRN pain.
Detoxification or maintenance: See package insert.
Unintentional overdoses have resulted in fatalities and severe adverse events such as 
respiratory depression and cardiac arrhythmias. Use with caution in hepatic (avoid in 
severe cases) and biliary tract impairment. May cause respiratory depression, sedation, 
increased intracranial pressure, hypotension, and bradycardia. Cardiac QT interval 
prolongation and serious arrhythmias have occurred mostly with higher doses; avoid use 
with other medications which may prolong QT interval.
Average T½: children 19 hr, and adults 35 hr. Duration of action PO is 6–8 hr initially and 22–48 hr 
after repeated doses. Respiratory effects last longer than analgesia. Accumulation may occur with 
continuous use making it necessary to adjust dose.

Nevirapine may decrease serum levels of methadone. Fatalities have been reported with abuse in 
combination with benzodiazepines. Serotonin syndrome has been reported with use with selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRIs), TCAs, 
5-­HT3 antagonists, MAO inhibitors, and drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter 
system (e.g., trazodone, tramadol). Methadone is a substrate for CYP 450 3A3/4, 2D6, and 1A2 and 
inhibitor of 2D6.
See Chapter 6 for equianalgesic dosing and onset of action. Adjust dose in renal failure (see 
Chapter 31).
A Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)is required for healthcare providers to 
ensure the benefits outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse. See www.fda.gov/

Readily crosses placental membranes and distributes into breast milk (maternal doses 
≤20 mg/24 hr is considered safe but there is insufficient data to support safe use with 
maternal doses >20 mg/24 hr). Blood dyscrasias, dermatitis, hepatitis, arthralgia, CNS 
reactions, pruritis, nephritis, hypoprothrombinemia, agranulocytosis, headache, fever, and 
hypothyroidism may occur.
May increase the effects of oral anticoagulants. When correcting hyperthyroidism, existing 
β-­blocker, digoxin, and theophylline doses may need to be reduced to avoid potential toxicities.

Contraindicated in pheochromocytoma and active liver disease. Use with caution if patient is 
receiving haloperidol, propranolol, lithium, or sympathomimetics. Positive Coombs test rarely 
associated with hemolytic anemia. Fever, leukopenia, sedation, memory impairment, 
hepatitis, GI disturbances, orthostatic hypotension, black tongue, and gynecomastia may 
occur. May interfere with lab tests for creatinine, urinary catecholamines, uric acid, and AST.
May increase the AV blocking effects of β-­blockers and antihypertensive effects of other antihyperten­
sives. α2-­antagonist antidepressants, serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and methyl­
phenidate may reduce the antihypertensive effects of methyldopa. Do not use in combination with 
MAO inhibitors (may enhance adverse effects of methyldopa). Do not coadminister oral doses with 
iron; decreases methyldopa absorption. Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31).

May increase serum concentrations/effects of tricyclic antidepressants, dopamine agonists (e.g., 
haloperidol), phenytoin, phenobarbital, and warfarin. May decrease the effects of antihypertensive 
drugs. Effect of methylphenidate may be potentiated by MAO inhibitors; hypertensive crisis may 
also occur if used within 14 days of discontinuance of the MAO inhibitor.
Extended/sustained-­release dosage forms have either an 8-­ or 24-­hr dosage interval (as 
stipulated previously). Concerta dosage form delivers 22.2% of its dose as an immediate-­release 
product with the remaining amounts as an extended-­release product (e.g., 18-­mg strength: 4 mg 
as immediate release and 14 mg as extended release). Jornay PM is dosed only in the evening and 
should NOT be taken in the morning. Do not consume alcohol with Ritalin LA dosage form, because 
it may result in a more rapid release of the drug. Do not expose transdermal application site to

Non–extended-­release oral-­dosage forms: Start at 1–2 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ BID (max. initial dose: 
25 mg/dose); if needed, adjust dose up to a max. dose of 6 mg/kg/24 hr up to 200 mg/24 hr.
Extended-­release tabs (≥6 yr and adolescent): Start at 1 mg/kg/dose (max. dose: 50 mg) PO 
once daily; if needed, adjust dose up to a max. dose of 2 mg/kg/24 hr or 200 mg/24 hr once 
daily (higher doses have not been evaluated).
Adult:
Non–extended-­release tabs: Start at 50–100 mg/24 hr PO ÷ once daily–BID; if needed, increase 
dosage at weekly intervals to desired blood pressure. Usual effective dosage range is 100–200 
mg/24 hr. Doses >450 mg/24 hr have not been studied. Patients with bronchospastic diseases 
should receive the lowest possible daily dose divided TID.
Extended-­release tabs: Start at 25–100 mg/24 hr PO once daily; if needed, increase dosage at 
weekly intervals to desired blood pressure. Usual dosage range is 50–200 mg/24 hr. Doses >400 
mg/24 hr have not been studied.
Contraindicated in sinus bradycardia, heart block >1st degree, sick sinus syndrome (except with 
functioning pacemaker), cardiogenic shock, and uncompensated CHF. Use with caution in 
hepatic dysfunction, peripheral vascular disease, history of severe anaphylactic 
hypersensitivity drug reactions, pheochromocytoma, and concurrent use with verapamil, 
diltiazem, or anesthetic agents that may decrease myocardial function. Should not be used 
with bronchospastic diseases. Reserpine and other drugs that deplete catecholamines (e.g., 
MAO inhibitors) may increase the effects of metoprolol. Metoprolol is a CYP 450 2D6 substrate. 
Poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers who concomitantly use CYP 2D6 inhibitors will 
have significant increases in metoprolol blood levels to decrease its cardioselectivity.
Avoid abrupt cessation of therapy in ischemic heart disease; angina, ventricular arrhythmias, and MI 
have occurred. Common side effects include bradyarrhythmia, heart block, heart failure, pruritus, 
rash, GI disturbances, dizziness, fatigue, and depression. Bronchospasm, dyspnea, and elevations 
in transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and LDH have all been reported.

No dosing adjustments are required based on race or gender, or in patients with severe renal 
dysfunction or mild to moderate hepatic function impairment. Effect of severe hepatic function 
impairment on micafungin pharmacokinetics has not been evaluated. Higher dosage requirements 
in premature and young infants may be attributed to the faster drug clearance due to lower protein 
binding. Higher treatment doses in infants and children have been reported at 8.6–12 mg/kg/dose 
IV once daily.
May cause GI disturbances, phlebitis, rash, hyperbilirubinemia, liver function test elevation, head­
ache, fever, and rigor. Anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, TEN, Stevens-­Johnson 
syndrome, and hemolysis have been reported. Micafungin is CYP450 3A isoenzyme substrate and 
weak inhibitor. May increase the effects/toxicity of nifedipine and sirolimus.
Safety and efficacy in children ≥4 mo have been demonstrated based on well-­controlled studies and

Contraindicated in patients with narrow-­angle glaucoma and shock. Use with caution in 
CHF, renal impairment (adjust dose; see Chapter 31), pulmonary disease, hepatic 
dysfunction, and neonates. Causes respiratory depression, hypotension, and bradycardia. 
Cardiovascular monitoring is recommended. Use lower doses or reduce dose when given in 
combination with narcotics or in patients with respiratory compromise.
Higher recommended dosage for younger patients (6 mo–5 yr) is attributed to the water-­soluble 
properties of midazolam and the higher percent body water for younger patients.
Drug is a substrate for CYP 450 3A4. Serum concentrations may be increased by cimetidine, clarithro­

FORMULARY
For explanation of icons, see p. 667 
Mometasone is a CYP 450 3A4 substrate; concurrent administration with ketoconazole and other 
CYP 450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., protease inhibitors) may increase mometasone levels, resulting 
in Cushing syndrome and adrenal suppression. Blurred vision, cataracts, and glaucoma have 
been reported. Use with caution with hepatic impairment; increased drug exposure is possible.
INTRANASAL: Clear nasal passages and shake nasal spray well before each use. Onset of action for 
nasal symptoms of allergic rhinitis has been shown to occur within 11 hr after the first dose. Nasal 
burning and irritation may occur. Nasal septal perforation and taste and smell disturbances have 
been rarely reported. A clinical trial in children 6–17 yr old was not able to demonstrate effective­
ness for treating nasal polyps.
ORAL INHALATION (all forms): Rinse mouth after each use. Fever, allergic rhinitis, URI, UTI, GI discomfort, 
and sore throat have been reported in children. Musculoskeletal pain, oral candidiasis, arthralgia, and 
fatigue may occur. May potentially worsen tuberculosis, fungal, bacterial, viral or parasitic infection, or 
ocular herpes simplex. Do not use Asmanex Twisthaler if allergic to milk proteins. The Twisthaler dosage 
form requires a minimum 30–60 L/min inspiratory flow rate to assure proper dose delivery. Breast-­feeding 
information is currently unknown, but most experts consider use of inhaled corticosteroids acceptable.
MOMETASONE + FOMOTEROL (Dulera): Common side effects include nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, 
and headache. Angioedema, anaphylaxis, and arrhythmias have been reported. See Formoterol for 
additional remarks.
TOPICAL USE: HPA axis suppression and skin atrophy have been reported with cream and ointment 
use in infants 6–23 mo. Avoid application/contact to face, eyes, underarms, groin, and mucous 
membranes. Occlusive dressings and use in diaper dermatitis are not recommended. 
MONTELUKAST
Singulair and generics
Antiasthmatic, antiallergy, leukotriene receptor antagonist
Chewable tabs: 4, 5 mg; contains phenylalanine
Tabs: 10 mg
Oral granules: 4 mg per packet (30s)
Asthma and allergic rhinitis:
Child (6 mo–5 yr): 4 mg (oral granules or chewable tablet) PO QHS; minimum age for 
use in asthma (per product label) is 12 mo.
Child (6–14 yr): 5 mg (chewable tablet) PO QHS
≥15 yr and adult: 10 mg PO QHS

additional doses should not be administered within 24 hr):
Child (6–14 yr): 5 mg (chewable tablet) PO
≥15 yr and adult: 10 mg PO
Chewable tablet dosage form is contraindicated in phenylketonuric patients. Side effects 
include: headache, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, fatigue, dizziness, cough, and elevated 
liver enzymes. Diarrhea, enuresis, epistaxis, pulmonary eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, 
hypersensitivity reactions (including Stevens-­Johnson and TEN), pharyngitis, nausea, otitis, 
sinusitis, and viral infections have been reported in children. Neuropsychiatric events, 
including aggression, anxiety, dream abnormalities, obsessive-­compulsive symptoms, 
hallucinations, depression, suicidal behavior, and insomnia, have been reported.
Drug is a substrate for CYP 450 3A4 and 2C9. Phenobarbital and rifampin may induce hepatic 
metabolism to increase the clearance of montelukast.
Doses may be administered with or without food.

Naloxone may be used to reverse effects, especially respiratory depression. Causes 
histamine release resulting in itching and possible bronchospasm. Low-­dose naloxone 
infusion may be used for itching. Inflammatory masses (e.g., granulomas) have been 
reported with continuous infusions via indwelling intrathecal catheters.
Dosage reduction may be necessary with liver cirrhosis. See Chapter 6 for equianalgesic dosing. 
Pregnancy category changes to “D” if used for prolonged periods or in higher doses at term. 
Rectal dosing is same as oral dosing but is not recommended due to poor absorption. Controlled/
sustained-­release oral tablets must be administered whole. Controlled-­release oral capsules may 
be opened and the entire contents sprinkled on applesauce immediately prior to ingestion. Be 
aware of the various oral solution concentrations; the concentrated oral solution (100 mg/5 mL) 
has been associated with accidental overdoses. Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31).
The FDA has assigned a REMS for Opioid Analgesia; see www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG. The 
REMS strongly encourages the (1) completion of a REMS-­compliant education program; (2) counsel 
patients/caregivers on prescription safe use, risks, storage, and disposal; (3) emphasize the 
importance of reading the Medication Guide provided by pharmacists at all times; and (4) consider 
other methods for improving patient, household, and community safety.

Avoid contact with the eyes. Topical cream is not intended for use in lesions >10 cm in 
length or 100 cm2 in surface area. Do not use topical ointment preparation on open 
wounds because of concerns about systemic absorption of polyethylene glycol. May cause 
minor local irritation and dry skin. Intranasal route may cause nasal stinging, taste 
disorder, headache, rhinitis, and pharyngitis. Severe allergic reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, 
urticaria, angioedema and rash) have been reported.

mg/24 hr for 1–2 yr and taper prednisone regimen.
Steroid dependent: 12–18 mg/kg/dose or 600 mg/m2/dose PO BID up to a max. dose of 2000 
mg/24 hr for at least 12 mo.
Adult (in combination with corticosteroids and cyclosporine; check specific transplantation proto­
col for specific dosage):
IV: 2000–3000 mg/24 hr ÷ BID
Oral:
Caps, tabs, or suspension: 2000–3000 mg/24 hr PO ÷ BID
Delayed-­release tabs (Myfortic): 720–1080 mg PO BID
Check specific transplantation protocol for specific dosage. Mycophenolate mofetil is a 
prodrug for mycophenolic acid. Owing to differences in absorption, the delayed-­release 
tablets should not be interchanged with other oral-­dosage forms on an equivalent 
milligram-­to-­milligram basis. Increases risk of first trimester pregnancy loss and increased 
risk of congenital malformations (especially external ear and facial abnormalities including 
cleft lip and palate, and anomalies of the distal limbs, heart, and esophagus).
Common side effects may include headache, hypertension, diarrhea, vomiting, bone marrow suppres­
sion, anemia, fever, opportunistic infections, and sepsis. May cause drowsiness and increase the risk 
for bacterial, fungal, protozoal, and viral infections, and lymphomas or other malignancies. GI bleeds 
and increased risk for rejection in heart transplant patients switched from calcineurin inhibitors 
(e.g., cyclosporine and tacrolimus) and CellCept to sirolimus and CellCept have been reported. Cases 
of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), pure red cell aplasia (PRCA), posttransplant 
lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), and hypogammaglobulinemia have also been reported.
Use of mycophenolic acid (Myfortic) should be avoided in patients with hypoxanthine-­guanine 
phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) deficiency (e.g., Lesch-­Nyhan and Kelley-­Seegmiller syndrome) 
because it may exacerbate disease symptoms characterized by increased uric acid leading to acute 
arthritis, tophi, nephrolithiasis/urolithiasis, and renal failure.
Use with caution in patients with active GI disease or renal impairment (GFR <25 mL/min/1.73 m2) 
outside of the immediate posttransplant period. In adults with renal impairment, avoid doses >2 
g/24 hr and observe carefully. Dose should be interrupted or reduced in the presence of neutropenia 
(ANC <1.3 × 103/microliter). No dose adjustment is needed for patients experiencing delayed graft 
function postoperatively.

Drug interactions: (1) Displacement of phenytoin or theophylline from protein-­binding sites will 
decrease total serum levels and increase free serum levels of these drugs. Salicylates displace 
mycophenolate to increase free levels of mycophenolate. (2) Competition for renal tubular secretion 
results in increased serum levels of acyclovir, ganciclovir, probenecid, and mycophenolate (when 
any of these are used together). (3) Avoid live and live attenuated vaccines (including influenza); 
decreases vaccine effectiveness. (4) Proton pump inhibitors, antacids, cholestyramine, cyclospo­
rine, and telmisartan may reduce mycophenolate levels.

Child >20 kg or >5 yr: 2 mg/dose. May repeat PRN Q2–3 min.
Continuous infusion (child and adult): 0.005 mg/kg loading dose followed by infusion of 0.0025 mg/
kg/hr has been recommended. A range of 0.0025–0.16 mg/kg/hr has been reported. Taper gradu­
ally to avoid relapse.
Adult: 0.4–2 mg/dose. May repeat PRN Q2–3 min. Use 0.1-­ to 0.2-­mg increments in opiate-­dependent 
patients.
Intranasal route for opiate intoxication (full reversal):
All ages: 4 mg (0.1 mL) of nasal liquid (Narcan) into one nostril Q2–3 min PRN in alternating nostrils.
Opioid-­dependent patient at risk for opioid withdrawal: Use lower 2 mg (0.1 mL) nasal liquid (Narcan) 
into one nostril Q2–3 min PRN in alternating nostrils. Alternatively, the 2 mg/2 mL intravenous (IV) 
syringe dosage form with nasal adapter may be used by administering 1 mg (1 mL) per nostril.
Opiate-­induced pruritus (limited data): 0.25–2 mCg/kg/hr IV; a dose-­finding study in 59 children 
suggests a minimal dose of 1 mCg/kg/hr when used as prophylactic therapy. Doses ≥3 mCg/kg/hr 
increases the risk for reduced pain control.
Short duration of action may necessitate multiple doses. For severe intoxication, doses of 0.2 
mg/kg may be required. If no response is achieved after a cumulative dose of 10 mg, 
reevaluate diagnosis. In the nonarrest situation, use the lowest dose effective (may 
start at 0.001 mg/kg/dose). See Chapter 6 for additional information.
Will produce narcotic withdrawal syndrome in patients with chronic dependence. Use with caution in 
patients with chronic cardiac disease. Abrupt reversal of narcotic depression may result in nausea, 
vomiting, diaphoresis, tachycardia, hypertension, and tremulousness. Aggressive behavior has 
been reported in abrupt reversal of an opioid overdose. False-­positive test for urine opiates screen 
may occur.
IV administration is preferred. Onset of action may be delayed with other routes of administration.

lacrimation, bradycardia, hypotension, fatigue, confusion, respiratory depression, and 
seizures. Titrate for each patient, but avoid excessive cholinergic effects.
For reversal of neuromuscular blockade, infants and small children may be at greater risk of compli­
cations from incomplete reversal of neuromuscular blockade due to decreased respiratory reserve.
For diagnosis of myasthenia gravis (MG), administer atropine 0.011 mg/kg/dose IV immediately 
before or IM (0.011 mg/kg/dose) 30 min before neostigmine. For treatment of MG, patients may

Use with caution in patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction. Contraindicated in moderate/
severe hepatic impairment (Child-­Pugh Class B or C) and postexposure (occupational or 
nonoccupational) prophylactic regimens. Most frequent side effects with continuous therapy 
include skin rash (may be life-­threatening, including Stevens-­Johnson syndrome and DRESS; 
permanently discontinue and never restart), fever, abnormal liver function tests, headache, and 
nausea. Discontinue therapy if any of the following occurs: severe rash; rash with fever, blistering, 
oral lesions, conjunctivitis or muscle aches. Permanently discontinue and do not restart therapy if 
symptomatic hepatitis, severe transaminase elevations or hypersensitivity reactions occur.
Life-­threatening hepatotoxicity has been reported primarily during the first 12 wk of continuous 
therapy. Patients with increased serum transaminase or a history of hepatitis B or C infection prior 
to nevirapine are at greater risk for hepatotoxicity. Women, including pregnant women, with CD4 cell 
counts >250/mm3 or men with CD4 cell counts >400/mm3 are at risk for hepatotoxicity. Monitor liver 
function tests (obtain transaminases immediately after development of hepatitis signs/symptoms, 
hypersensitivity reactions, or rash) and complete blood counts. Hypophosphatemia has been reported.
Nevirapine induces the CYP 450 3A4 drug metabolizing isoenzyme to cause an autoinduction of its 
own metabolism within the first 2–4 wk of therapy and has the potential to interact with many 
drugs. Carefully review the patient’s drug profile for other drug interactions each time nevirap­
ine is initiated or when a new drug is added to a regimen containing nevirapine.
Doses can be administered with food and concurrently with didanosine.

renal dysfunction, and in patients with history of jaundice, hepatobiliary disease, or peptic 
ulcer. Adverse reactions of flushing, pruritus, or GI distress may occur with oral 
administration. May cause hyperglycemia, hyperuricemia, blurred vision, abnormal liver 
function tests, dizziness, and headaches. Burning sensation of the skin, skin discoloration, 
hepatitis, and elevated creatine kinase have been reported. May cause false-­positive urine 
catecholamines (fluorometric methods) and urine glucose (Benedict reagent).

Child (see remarks):
Hypertension:
Continuous IV infusion for severe hypertension: Start at 0.5–1 mCg/kg/min, dose may be 
increased as needed every 15–30 min up to a max. of 4–5 mCg/kg/min.
Adult (see remarks):
Hypertension:
Oral:
Immediate release: 20 mg PO TID, dose may be increased after 3 days to 40 mg PO TID if 
needed.
Sustained release: 30 mg PO BID, dose may be increased after 3 days to 60 mg PO BID if 
needed.
Continuous IV infusion: Start at 5 mg/hr, increase dose as needed by 2.5 mg/hr Q5–15 min up to 
a max. dose of 15 mg/hr. Following attainment of desired BP, decrease infusion to 3 mg/hr and 
adjust rate as needed to maintain desired response.
Reported use in children has been limited to a small number of preterm infants, infants, and 
children.
Contraindicated in advanced aortic stenosis. Avoid systemic hypotension in patients following 
an acute cerebral infarct or hemorrhage. Use with caution in hepatic or renal dysfunction by 
carefully titrating dose. The drug undergoes significant first-­pass metabolism through the liver and 
is excreted in the urine (60%). Use caution when converting to another dosage form; they are NOT 
equivalent on a milligram-­per-­milligram basis.
May cause headache, dizziness, asthenia, peripheral edema, and GI symptoms. Nicardipine is a sub­
strate for CYP 450 3A and inhibitor of CYP 450 2 C9/19. Cimetidine increases the effects/toxicity of 
nicardipine. Nicardipine may increase effect/toxicity of cyclosporine and tacrolimus. See Nifedipine 
for additional drug and food interactions.
Onset of action for orally administered drug is 20 min with peak effects in 0.5 to 2 hr. Onset of action 
of intravenously administered drug is 1 min. Duration of action following a single IV or PO dose is 
3 hr. To reduce the risk for venous thrombosis, phlebitis, and vascular impairment with IV admin­
istration, do not use small veins (e.g., dorsum of hand or wrist). Avoid intra-­arterial administration 
or extravasation. For additional information, see Chapter 4.

Child (see remarks for precautions):
Chronic hypertension:
Sustained release tabs: Start with 0.25–0.5 mg/kg/24 hr (initial max. dose: 
30–60 mg/24 hr) ÷ Q12–24 hr. May increase to max. dose: 3 mg/kg/24 hr up to 
120 mg/24 hr.
Adult:
Chronic hypertension or angina:
Sustained-­release tabs: Start with 30 or 60 mg PO once daily. May increase to max. dose 
of 90 mg/24 hr for Adalat CC, Afeditab CR, and Nifediac CC, and 120 mg/24 hr for 
Procardia XL.
Use of immediate-­release dosage form in children is controversial and has been abandoned 
by many. Use with caution in children with acute CNS injury due to increased risk for 
stroke, seizure, hepatic impairment, and altered level of consciousness. To prevent rapid 
decrease in blood pressure in children, an initial dose of ≤0.25 mg/kg is recommended.
Use with caution in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), aortic stenosis, GI obstruction/
narrowing (bezoar formation), and cirrhosis (reduced drug clearance). May cause severe hypoten­
sion, peripheral edema, flushing, tachycardia, headaches, dizziness, nausea, palpitations, and 
syncope. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis has been reported.
Although overall use in adults has been abandoned, the immediate-­release dosage form is 
­contraindicated in adults with severe obstructive coronary artery disease or recent MI and in 
hypertensive emergencies.
Nifedipine is a substrate for CYP 450 3A3/4, and 3A5-­7. Do not administer with grapefruit juice; may 
increase bioavailability and effects. Itraconazole and ketoconazole may increase nifedipine levels 
and/or effects. CYP 3A inducers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamaze­
pine) may reduce nifedipine’s effects. Nifedipine may increase phenytoin, cyclosporine, and digoxin 
levels. For hypertensive emergencies, see Chapter 4.
For sublingual (SL) administration, capsule must be punctured and liquid expressed into the 
patient’s mouth. A small amount is absorbed via the SL route. Most effects are due to swallowing 
and oral absorption. Do not crush or chew sustained-­release tablet dosage form.

Patch: 0.2–0.4 mg/hr initially, then titrate to 0.4–0.8 mg/hr; apply new patch daily (tolerance is 
minimized by removing patch for 10–12 hr/24 hr)
Contraindicated in glaucoma, with increased ICP, cerebral hemorrhage, traumatic brain 
injury, shock, severe anemia, concurrent phosphodiesterase-­5 inhibitor (e.g., sildenafil), 
and concurrent guanylate cyclase stimulator (e.g., riociguat). In small doses (1–2 mCg/kg/
min) acts mainly on systemic veins and decreases preload. At 3–5 mCg/kg/min acts on 
systemic arterioles to decrease resistance. May cause headache, flushing, hypersensitivity 
reactions, hypotension, GI upset, blurred vision, and methemoglobinemia. Use with caution 
in severe renal impairment, and hepatic failure. IV nitroglycerin may antagonize 
anticoagulant effect of heparin.
Decrease dose gradually in patients receiving drug for prolonged periods to avoid withdrawal reac­
tion. Must use polypropylene infusion sets to avoid adsorption of drug to plastic tubing. Use in 
heparized patients may result in a decrease of PTT with subsequent rebound effect on discontinu­
ation of nitroglycerin.
Onset (duration) of action: IV: 1–2 min (3–5 min); sublingual: 1–3 min (30–60 min); PO sustained 
release: 40 min (4–8 hr); topical ointment: 20–60 min (2–12 hr); and transdermal patch: 40–60 
min (18–24 hr).

Prediluted injection in 0.9% sodium chloride:
Nipride RTU: 0.2 mg/mL (100 mL), 0.5 mg/mL (100 mL)
Child, adolescent, and adult: IV, continuous infusion
Dose: Start at 0.3–0.5 mCg/kg/min, titrate to effect. Usual dose is 3–4 mCg/kg/min. 
Max. dose: 10 mCg/kg/min.
Contraindicated in patients with decreased cerebral perfusion and in situations of 
compensatory hypertension (increased ICP). Monitor for hypotension and acidosis. Dilute 
with D5W and protect from light.
Pediatric efficacy is supported by a dose-­ranging trial, an open-­label trial, and adult trials. No novel 
safety issues were found in the aforementioned pediatric trials.
Nitroprusside is nonenzymatically converted to cyanide, which is converted to thiocyanate. Cyanide 
may produce metabolic acidosis and methemoglobinemia; thiocyanate may produce psychosis and 
seizures. Monitor thiocyanate levels if used for more than 48 hr or in a dose equal to or greater 
than 4 mCg/kg/min. Thiocyanate levels should be less than 50 mg/L. Monitor cyanide levels 
(toxic levels >2 mCg/mL) in patients with hepatic dysfunction and thiocyanate levels in patients 
with renal dysfunction.
Onset of action is 2 min with a 1-­ to 10-­min duration of effect.

night × 2 days, followed by Q1 hr while awake × 5 days, and then QID until treatment has been 
completed.
Pruritus, local irritation, taste perversion, dizziness, earache have been reported with otic 
use. Ocular burning/discomfort is frequent with ophthalmic use. Consult with 
ophthalmology in corneal ulcers.
When otic solution is being used, the solution should be warmed by holding the bottle in the hand for 
1–2 min. The use of cold solutions may result in dizziness. For otitis externa, the patient should lie 
with the affected ear upward before instillation and remain in the same position after dose admin­
istration for 5 min to enhance drug delivery. For acute otitis media with tympanostomy tubes, the 
patient should lie in the same position prior to instillation and the tragus should be pumped 4 
times after the dose to assist in drug delivery to the middle ear.
Systemic use of ofloxacin is typically replaced by levofloxacin, its S-­isomer, which has a more favor­
able side effect profile than ofloxacin. See levofloxacin.

to hypotension, pharmacodynamically sensitive to olanzapine, or nonsmoking females ≥65 yr old) 
with a target dose of 10 mg once daily within 5–7 days. If needed, increase or decrease dose by 5 
mg daily at weekly intervals. Usual dosage range: 10–15 mg once daily. Additional clinical assess­
ment is recommended for doses >10 mg/24 hr (doses >20 mg/24 hr have not been evaluated).
IM DOSING:
Short acting for acute agitation associated with bipolar I or schizophrenia:
Child and adolescent (limited retrospective data in 15 children and 35 adolescents): ≤12 yr: 5 
mg and adolescent (13–17 yr): 10 mg. Dosing frequencies and max. doses were not reported.
Adult: 10 mg (5 mg for geriatric patients and 2.5 mg for individuals who are debilitated, predis­
posed to hypotension, or pharmacodynamically sensitive to olanzapine). If needed, additional 
doses × 2 may be given; second dose 2 hr after the first dose and third dose 4 hr after the 
second dose. Recommended max. dose is 30 mg/24 hr (10 mg × 3 given 2–4 hr apart); safety of 
doses >30 mg /24 hr has not been evaluated.
Long-­acting pamoate salt (Zyprexa Relprevv) for schizophrenia (adult): see remarks and package 
insert for specific dosage based on established oral dosage.
Use with caution in cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, hypotensive conditions, 
diabetes/hyperglycemia, elevated serum lipids and cholesterol, paralytic ileus, hepatic 
impairment, seizure disorders, narrow angle glaucoma, and prostatic hypertrophy. 
Medication exhibits anticholinergic effects.
Common side effects include orthostatic hypotension, peripheral edema, hypercholesterolemia, hyper­
prolactinemia, appetite simulation, weight gain (greater in adolescents than adults; monitoring 
is recommended), hypertriglyceridemia, constipation, xerostomia, akathisia, asthenia, dizziness, 
somnolence, tremor, and personality disorder. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome, dystonia, cognitive 
and motor impairment, tardive dyskinesia (irreversible with cumulative high doses), neutropenia, 
leukopenia, agranulocytosis, suicidal intent, acute pancreatitis, pulmonary embolism, increases in 
liver function tests (ALT, AST, GGT), DRESS, and hyperthermia have been reported.
Olanzapine is a major substate for CYP 450 1A2 and minor substrate for 2D6. It also is a weak inhibi­
tor to CYP 450 1A2, 2C9/19. Do not use in combination with alcohol, benzodiazepines, or opiates 
due to increased risk for sedation and cardiopulmonary depression. Caution is also indicated 
with anticholinergic agents (e.g., azelastine, glycopyrrolate), as olanzapine may enhance the 
anticholinergic effects. Use with QTc-­prolonging medications may further increase the risk for QTc 
prolongation. Metoclopramide may enhance neurological side effects of olanzapine. Do not use oral 
disintegrating tablets in phenylketonuria.
T½: 37 hr for children and 21–54 hr for adults via PO route. Short-­acting IM T½ in adults is similar to 
PO route but long-­acting IM T½ is ∼30 days in adults.
Maintenance treatment for bipolar I disorder and schizophrenia has not been systematically evalu­
ated in adolescents. Therefore it is recommended to utilize the lowest dose to maintain efficacy and 
to reassess the need for maintenance treatment periodically for this age group.

Avoid use in congenital long-­QTc syndrome. Bronchospasm, tachycardia, hypokalemia, 
seizures, headaches, lightheadedness, constipation, diarrhea and transient increases in 
AST, ALT, and bilirubin may occur. Transient blindness (resolution within a few min up to 
48 hr), arthralgia, Stevens-­Johnson syndrome, TEN, hepatic dysfunction, and rare/transient 
ECG changes (including QTc-­interval prolongation) have been reported. Data limited for 
use in children below 3 yr of age.
ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities, CHF, or bradyarrhyth­
mias. Drug clearance is higher for surgical and cancer patients <18 yr as compared with adults. 
Clearance is slower for children 1–4 mo old compared with children >4–24 mo old.
Ondansetron is a substrate for CYP 450 1A2, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A3/4 drug metabolizing enzymes. It is 
likely that the inhibition/loss of one of the previously listed enzymes will be compensated by others 
and may result in insignificant changes to the elimination of ondansetron, which may be affected 
by CYP 450 enzyme inducers. Ultrarapid metabolizers of CYP 450 2D6 is associated with decreased 
response and use of an alternative drug not predominantly metabolized by CYP 2D6 (e.g., 
granisetron) is recommended. Follow theophylline, phenytoin, or warfarin levels closely, if used in 
combination. Use with apomorphine may result in profound hypotension and loss of consciousness 
and is contraindicated.
To administer the oral film dosage form (Zuplenz), film must be placed on top of patient’s tongue,

Prophylaxis of influenza (initiate therapy within 2 days of exposure; see remarks):
Child 3 mo–<1 yr: 3 mg/kg/dose PO once daily; alternative dosage based on age:
3–5 mo: 20 mg PO once daily
6–11 mo: 25 mg PO once daily
Child 1–12 yr:
≤15 kg: 30 mg PO once daily
16–23 kg: 45 mg PO once daily
24–40 kg: 60 mg PO once daily
>40 kg: 75 mg PO once daily
≥13 yr old and adult: 75 mg PO once daily for a minimum of 7 days and up to 6 wk; initiate therapy 
within 2 days of exposure.
Currently indicated for the treatment of influenza A and B strains. Use in children <1 yr of 
age has not been recommended due to concerns of excessive CNS penetration and 
fatalities in 7-­day-­old rats.
Nausea and vomiting generally occur within the first 2 days and are the most common adverse 
effects. Insomnia, vertigo, seizures, hypothermia, neuropsychiatric events (may result in fatal 
outcomes), arrhythmias, rash, and toxic epidermal necrolysis have also been reported. If the 
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is 10–30 mL/min, reduce treatment dose to 75 mg PO once daily 
× 5 days for adults. (See Chapter 31.)
PROPHYLACTIC USE: Oseltamivir is not a substitute for annual flu vaccination. Safety and efficacy 
have been demonstrated for ≤6 wk of therapy; duration of protection lasts for as long as dosing 
is continued. Adjust prophylaxis dose if GFR is 10–30 mL/min by extending the dosage interval to 
once every other day.
Probenecid increases oseltamivir levels. Oseltamivir decreases the efficacy of the nasal influenza 
vaccine (live attenuated influenza vaccine, FluMist); avoid administration of vaccine within 2 wk 
before or 48 hr after oseltamivir administration unless medically indicated.
Dosage adjustments in hepatic impairment, severe renal disease, and dialysis have not been 
established for either treatment or prophylactic use. The safety and efficacy of repeated treatment 
or prophylaxis courses have not been evaluated. Doses may be administered with or without food.

Adult (IM/IV): 250–2000 mg/dose Q4–6 hr; use higher dosage range for endocarditis or severe 
infections
Max. dose (all ages): 12 g/24 hr.
Rash and GI disturbances are common. Leukopenia, reversible hepatotoxicity, and acute 
interstitial nephritis has been reported. Hematuria and azotemia have occurred in 
neonates and infants with high doses. May cause false-­positive urinary and serum 
proteins.
Probenecid increases serum oxacillin levels. Tetracyclines may antagonize the bactericidal 
effects of oxacillin.
CSF penetration is poor unless meninges are inflamed. Use the lower end of the usual dosage range 
for patients with creatinine clearances <10 mL/min. Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31).

There is a potential for abuse; CNS and respiratory depression, increased ICP, histamine 
release, constipation, and GI distress may occur. Use with caution in severe renal 
impairment (increases T½) and mild/moderate hepatic dysfunction (use of one-­third to 
one-­half of usual dose has been recommended). Naloxone is the antidote. See Chapter 6 
for equianalgesic dosing. Check dosages of acetaminophen or aspirin when using 
combination products (e.g., Percocet, Percodan). Oxycodone is metabolized by the CYP 450 
3A4 (major) and 2D6 (minor) isoenzyme.
When controlled-­released tablets (e.g., Oxycontin) are being used, determine patient’s total 24-­hr 
requirement should be determined and divided by 2 to administer on a Q12 hr dosing interval. 
Oxycontin 80-­mg tablet is USED ONLY for opioid-­tolerant patients; this strength can cause fatal 
respiratory depression in opioid-­naive patients. Controlled-­release dosage form should not be used 
as a PRN analgesic and must be swallowed whole.

Initial doses (actual requirements are patient specific):
Enteric coated microspheres and microtabs:
Infant: 2000–4000 U lipase per 120 mL (formula or breast milk)
Child <4 yr: 1000 U lipase/kg/meal
Child ≥4 yr and adult: 500 U lipase/kg/meal
Max. dose (child–adult): 2500 U lipase/kg/meal, or 10,000 U lipase/kg/24 hr, or 4000 U lipase/g 
fat/24 hr.
Total daily dose should include approximately three meals and two to three snacks per day. Snack doses 
are approximately half of meal doses, depending on the amount of fat and food consumed.
May cause occult GI bleeding, allergic reactions to porcine proteins, hyperuricemia, and 
hyperuricosuria with high doses. Dose should be titrated to eliminate diarrhea and to 
minimize steatorrhea. Do not chew microspheres or microtabs. Concurrent administration 
with H2 antagonists or gastric acid pump inhibitors may enhance enzyme efficacy. Doses 
higher than 6000 U lipase/kg/meal have been associated with colonic strictures in children 
<12 yr. Nonenteric coated dosage forms (e.g., powder and tablet) are not preferred, owing 
to potential GI mucosal ulceration. Patients who are unable to swallow capsules intact 
may mix the contents with small amount of acidic soft foods (pH ≤4.5; such as 
applesauce) and swallow immediately after mixing.
Avoid use of generic pancreatic enzyme products because they been associated with treatment fail­
ures. Products not approved by the FDA are no longer allowed to be distributed in the United States.

May interfere with serum chromogranin A (CgA) diagnostic test for neuroendocrine tumors; discon­
tinue use at least 14 days prior to testing. False-­positive test for urine cannabinoid screen may 
occur.
Drug is a substrate for CYP 450 2C19 (major), 2D6 (minor), and 3A3/4 (minor) isoenzymes. 
Recommended dosage modification for ultrarapid metabolizers of CYP 2C19 is to increase the 
usual dose by fivefold. May decrease the absorption of itraconazole, ketoconazole, iron salts, and 
ampicillin esters. May increase the effect/toxicity of methotrexate.
Children 1–2 yr of age have demonstrated more rapid clearance of pantoprazole in pharmacokinetic 
studies; this age group may require higher doses. All oral doses may be taken with or without food. 
Do not crush or chew tablets. The extemporaneously compounded oral suspension may be less 
bioavailable owing to the loss of the enteric coating. Granules for delayed-­release oral suspension 
product may be mixed with 5 mL apple juice (administer immediately followed by rinsing container 
with more apple juice), or sprinkled on 1 teaspoonful of apple sauce (administer within 10 min); 
see package insert for NG administration.
For IV infusion, doses may be administered over 15 min at a concentration of 0.4–0.8 mg/mL or over 
2 min at a concentration of 4 mg/mL. Midazolam and zinc are not compatible with the IV dosage 
form. Parenteral routes other than IV are not recommended.

Contraindicated in intestinal obstruction. Use with caution in ulcerative bowel lesions to 
avoid renal toxicity via systemic absorption. Drug is generally poorly absorbed and 
therefore not indicated for sole treatment of extraintestinal amebiasis. Side effects include 
GI disturbance, hematuria, rash, ototoxicity, and hypocholesterolemia. Bacterial overgrowth 
of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi, may occur. May decrease the effects of

Status epilepticus: See Chapter 1 and remarks.
Loading dose (all ages): 20 mg/kg IV; max. dose: 1500 mg/24 hr
Maintenance for seizure disorders (initiate 12 hr after administration of loading dose):
Neonate: start with 5 mg/kg/24 hr PO/IV ÷ Q12 hr; usual range 4–8 mg/kg/24 hr PO/IV ÷ Q8–12 hr.
Infant/child: start with 5 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ BID–TID PO/IV; usual dose range (doses divided BID–TID):
6 mo–3 yr: 8–10 mg/kg/24 hr
4–6 yr: 7.5–9 mg/kg/24 hr
7–9 yr: 7–8 mg/kg/24 hr
10–16 yr: 6–7 mg/kg/24 hr
Note: Use once daily–BID dosing with extended release caps.
Adult: Start with 100 mg/dose Q8 hr IV/PO and carefully titrate (if needed) by 100 mg increments 
Q2–4 wk to 300–600 mg/24 hr (or 6–7 mg/kg/24 hr) ÷ Q8–24 hr IV/PO.
Contraindicated in patients with heart block or sinus bradycardia; those who are receiving 
delavirdine (decrease virologic response); and history of hydantoin hypersensitivity. Use 
with caution in patients with pacemakers or cardiac dysrhythmias because of its class IB 
antiarrhythmic properties. IM administration is not recommended because of erratic 
absorption and pain at injection site; consider fosphenytoin. Side effects include gingival 
hyperplasia, hirsutism, dermatitis, blood dyscrasia, ataxia, lupus-­like and Stevens-­Johnson 
syndromes, lymphadenopathy, liver damage, and nystagmus. Suicidal behavior or ideation, 
bradycardia, cardiac arrest, and multiorgan hypersensitivity (DRESS) have been reported. 
An increased risk for serious skin reactions (e.g., TEN and Stevens-­Johnson) may occur in 
patients with the HLA-­B*1502 allele; do not use this medication in individuals who carry 
this genotype.
Many drug interactions: levels may be increased by cimetidine, chloramphenicol, INH, sulfonamides, 
trimethoprim, etc. Levels may be decreased by some antineoplastic agents. Phenytoin induces 
hepatic microsomal enzymes (CYP 450 1A2, 2C8/9/19, and 3A3/4), leading to decreased effective­
ness of oral contraceptives, fosamprenavir (used without ritonavir), quinidine, valproic acid, 
theophylline, and other substrates to the previously listed CYP 450 hepatic enzymes. May increase 
levels of amprenavir when administered with fosamprenavir and ritonavir. May cause resistance 
to neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (e.g., 
pancuronium, vecuronium, rocuronium, and cisatracurium) and decrease concentrations of T4 and 
T3 (typically without clinical hypothyroidism).
The following initial maintenance dose modifications for HLA-­B*1502 allele noncarriers and CYP 450 
2C9 phenotypes have been recommended:
CYP 2C9 intermediate metabolizer: 25% reduction with therapeutic drug monitoring
CYP 2C9 poor metabolizer: 50% reduction with therapeutic drug monitoring
Ideal body weight should be used for calculating dosages. Suggested dosing intervals for specific 
oral dosage forms: extended release caps (once daily–BID); chewable tablets, and oral suspension 
(TID). Oral absorption reduced in neonates. T½ is variable (7–42 hr) and dose dependent. Drug is 
highly protein bound; free fraction of drug will be increased in patients with hypoalbuminemia.
For seizure disorders, therapeutic levels: 10–20 mg/L (free and bound phenytoin) OR 1–2 mg/L (free 
only). Monitor free phenytoin levels in hypoalbuminemia or renal insufficiency. Recommended 
serum sampling times: trough level (PO/IV) within 30 min prior to the next scheduled dose; peak 
or postload level (IV) 1 hr after the end of IV infusion. Steady state is usually achieved after 5–10 
days of continuous dosing. For routine monitoring, measure trough.
IV push/infusion rate: Not to exceed 0.5 mg/kg/min in neonates, or 1 mg/kg/min infants, children, 
and adults with maximum of 50 mg/min; may cause cardiovascular collapse. Consider fosphe­
nytoin in situations of tenuous IV access and risk for extravasation.

PIMECROLIMUS
Elidel and generics
Topical immunosuppressant, calcineurin inhibitor
Cream: 1% (30, 60, 100 g); contains benzyl alcohol and propylene glycol
Atopic dermatitis (second line therapy):
Child ≥2 yr, adolescent, and adult (see remarks): Apply a thin layer to affected area BID and 
rub in gently and completely. Reevaluate patient in 6 wk if lesions are not healed.
Do not use in children <2 yr (higher rate of upper respiratory infections), in immunocompromised 
patients, or with occlusive dressings (promotes systemic absorption). Avoid use on malignant or 
premalignant skin conditions as rare cases of lymphoma and skin malignancy have been 
reported with topical calcineurin inhibitors. Approved as a second line therapy for atopic 
dermatitis for patients who fail to respond, or do not tolerate, other approved therapies. Use 
medication for short periods of time by using the minimum amounts to control symptoms; long-­
term safety is unknown. Avoid contact with eyes, nose, mouth, and cut, infected, or scraped 
skin. Minimize and avoid exposure to natural and artificial sunlight, respectively.
Most common side effects include burning at the application site, headache, viral infections, and 
pyrexia. Skin discoloration, skin flushing associated with alcohol use, anaphylactic reactions, 
ocular irritation after application to the eye lids or near the eyes, angioneurotic edema, and facial 
edema have been reported. Drug is a CYP 450 3A3/4 substrate.

All doses based on piperacillin component.
Child and adolescent (IV): Severe infections (shortening the dosing interval to Q6 hr and lengthening 
the dose administration time to 4 hr (see remarks) may enhance the pharmacodynamic properties):
2–9 mo: 80 mg/kg/dose Q6–8 hr
>9 mo, child, and adolescent: 100 mg/kg/dose Q6–8 hr
Max. dose (all ages): 16 g/24 hr
Appendicitis or peritonitis (IV route for 7–10 days; dosing interval may be shortened to Q6 hr to 
enhance pharmacodynamic properties):
2–9 mo: 80 mg/kg/dose Q6–8 hr
>9 mo–adolescent:
≤40 kg: 100 mg/kg/dose (max. 3000 mg/dose) Q6–8 hr
>40 kg: 3 g/dose Q6 hr
Max. dose (all ages): 16 g/24 hr.
Adult:
Intra-­abdominal or soft tissue infections: 3 g IV Q6 hr
Nosocomial pneumonia: 4 g IV Q6 hr
Cystic fibrosis (antipseudomonal; see remarks):
All ages: 350–600 mg/kg/24 hr IV ÷ Q4–6 hr; max. dose: 24 g/24 hr.
Tazobactam is a β-­lactamase inhibitor, thus extending the spectrum of piperacillin. Like other 
penicillins, CSF penetration occurs only with inflamed meninges. GI disturbances, pruritus, 
rash, and headaches are common. Abnormal platelet aggregation and prolonged bleeding, 
serious skin reactions (e.g., Stevens-­Johnson, DRESS, acute generalized exanthematous 
pustulosis, and TEN) have been reported. Cystic fibrosis patients have an increased risk 
for fever and rash. Increases in renal failure risk (in critically ill adults) and incidence of 
acute kidney injury (in combination with IV vancomycin) have been reported.
Coagulation parameters should be tested more frequently and monitored regularly with high doses of heparin, 
warfarin, or other drugs affecting blood coagulation or thrombocyte function. May falsely decrease ami­
noglycoside serum levels if the drugs are infused close to one another; allow a minimum of 2 hr between 
infusions to prevent this interaction. May prolong the neuromuscular blockade effects of vecuronium.
Prolonging the dose administration time to 4 hr will maximize the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic 
properties by prolonging the time of drug concentration above the MIC; especially for pathogens 
with piperacillin MICs of 8–16 mCg/mL. Adjust dose in renal impairment, (see Chapter 31).

doses) approximately 1 hr after the last injection.
Adult:
IV intermittent: 1–2 g/dose ×1 IV. May repeat in 1–2 hr if muscle weakness is not relieved, then at 
Q10–12 hr PRN if cholinergic signs reappear.
IM: Use aforementioned ≥40-­kg child IM dosage.
In combination with atropine (Duodote, ATNNA; see remarks for description of symptoms):
Child and adult >41 kg:
Mild Symptoms of Nerve Agent or Insecticide Exposure: Inject one prefilled syringe IM ×1 and 
wait 10–15 min for effect. If severe symptoms emerge at any time after the first dose, inject 2 
additional prefilled syringes IM in rapid succession.
Severe Symptoms of Nerve Agent or Insecticide Exposure: Inject three prefilled syringes IM in rapid 
succession.
Contraindicated in poisonings due to phosphorus, inorganic phosphates, or organic phosphates 
without anticholinesterase activity. Do not use as an antidote for carbamate classes of 
pesticides. Removal of secretions and maintaining a patent airway is critical. May cause 
muscle rigidity, laryngospasm, and tachycardia after rapid IV infusion. Drug is generally 
ineffective if administered 36–48 hr after exposure. Additional doses may be necessary.
For IV administration, dilute to 50 mg/mL or less and infuse over 15–30 min (not to exceed 200 mg/
min). Reduce dosage in renal impairment since 80%–90% of the drug is excreted unchanged in 
the urine 12 hr after administration.

Nephrotic syndrome:
Child (use ideal body weight for obese patients): Starting dose of 2 mg/kg/24 hr PO (max. dose: 60 
mg/24 hr) ÷ once daily–TID is recommended. Further treatment plans are individualized. Consult 
a nephrologist.
See Chapter 10 for physiologic replacement, relative steroid potencies, and doses based on 
body surface area. Methylprednisolone is preferable in hepatic disease because prednisone 
must be converted to methylprednisolone in the liver.
Side effects may include: mood changes, seizures, hyperglycemia, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal 
distension, GI bleeding, HPA axis suppression, osteopenia, cushingoid effects, and cataracts with 
prolonged use. Prednisone is a CYP 450 3A3/4 substrate and inducer. Barbiturates, carbamaze­
pine, phenytoin, rifampin, and isoniazid may reduce the effects of prednisone, whereas estrogens 
may enhance the effects. Pregnancy category changes to “D” if used in the first trimester.

Use with caution in renal or hepatic disease and pulmonary insufficiency. Primidone is 
metabolized to phenobarbital and has the same drug interactions and toxicities (see 
Phenobarbital). In addition, primidone may cause vertigo, nausea, leukopenia, malignant 
lymphoma-­like syndrome, diplopia, nystagmus, and systemic lupus-­like syndrome. Monitor 
for suicidal behavior or ideation. Acetazolamide may decrease primidone absorption. Adjust 
dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31).
Monitor both primidone and phenobarbital levels. Therapeutic levels: 5–12 mg/L of primidone and 
15–40 mg/L of phenobarbital. Recommended serum sampling time at steady state: trough level 
obtained within 30 min prior to the next scheduled dose after 1–4 days of continuous dosing.

Infantile hemangioma (see remarks):
Infant (5 wk–5 mo and ≥2 kg; labeled dosing information for Hemangeol product): 0.6 mg/kg/dose 
BID PO (at least 9 hr apart) ×7 days, then increase to 1.1 mg/kg/dose BID PO ×14 days, followed 
by 1.7 mg/kg/dose BID PO ×6 mo.
Alternative dosing: Start at 1 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q8 hr PO. If tolerated after 1 day, increase dose to 
2 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q8 hr PO
Contraindicated in asthma, Raynaud syndrome, heart failure, and heart block. Not indicated 
for the treatment of hypertensive emergencies. Use with caution in presence of obstructive 
lung disease, diabetes mellitus, or renal or hepatic disease. May cause hypoglycemia, 
hypotension, nausea, vomiting, depression, weakness, impotence, bronchospasm, and 
heart block. Cutaneous reactions, including Stevens-­Johnson, TEN, exfoliative dermatitis, 
erythema multiforme, and urticaria have been reported. Acute hypertension has occurred 
after insulin-­induced hypoglycemia in patients on propranolol.
Therapeutic levels for beta-blockade: 50–100 ng/mL; ventricular arrhythmia: 40–85 ng/mL. Drug is 
metabolized by CYP 450 1A2, 2C18, 2C19 and 2D6 isoenzymes. Concurrent administration with barbitu­
rates, indomethacin, or rifampin may cause decreased activity of propranolol. Concurrent administration 
with cimetidine, hydralazine, flecainide, quinidine, chlorpromazine, or verapamil may lead to increased 
activity of propranolol. Avoid IV use of propranolol with calcium channel blockers; may increase effect of 
calcium channel blocker. Use with amiodarone may increase negative chronotropic effects.
For infantile hemangioma, monitor BP and HR 2 hr after initiating therapy and after dose increases. 
To reduce risk of hypoglycemia, administer doses during or right after a feeding; hold doses if 
child is not eating or is vomiting. Infants <6 mo must be fed every 4 hr. Common adverse effects 
(>10%) reported in clinical trials with Hemangeol include sleep disorders, aggravated respiratory 
tract infections (e.g., bronchitis and bronchiolitis) associated with cough/fever, diarrhea, and 
vomiting. Readjust dose periodically with changes (increases) in child’s body weight.

Do not abruptly discontinue medication as acute withdrawal symptoms occur. Dosage adjustment in 
hepatic impairment may be necessary as it is primarily hepatically metabolized. Quetiapine is a 
major substrate for CYP 450 3A4 and minor substrate for 2D6. Opioids and other CNS depressants 
may enhance CNS depressant effects. Carbamazepine may decrease the effects of quetiapine. 
Quetiapine may decrease dopamine agonist effects (e.g., anti-­parkinson agents) but may enhance 
the anticholinergic and QTc prolongation effects to those medications processing these risks. 
Always check for drug interactions as effects can be mild to severe.
Non–extended release dosage forms may be administered with or without food. Extended-­release tabs 
must be swallowed whole and administered preferably in the evening without food (a light meal 
of ≤300 calories is allowed). May convert patients from immediate-­release to extended-­release 
tablets at the equivalent total daily dose and administer once daily; individual dosage adjustments 
may be necessary.

As gluconate: 324–972 mg PO Q 8–12 hr.
Malaria:
Child and adult (give intravenously as gluconate; see remarks):
Loading dose: 10 mg/kg/dose IV (max. dose: 600 mg) over 1–2 hr followed by maintenance dose. 
Omit or decrease load if patient has received quinine or mefloquine.
Maintenance dose: 0.02 mg/kg/min IV as continuous infusion until oral therapy can be initiated. If 
more than 48 hr of intravenous therapy is required, reduce dose by 30%–50%.
Test dose is given to assess for idiosyncratic reaction to quinidine. Toxicity indicated by 
increase of QRS interval by ≥0.02 sec (skip dose or stop drug). May cause gastrointestinal 
(GI) symptoms, hypotension, tinnitus, TTP, rash, heart block and blood dyscrasias. When 
used alone, may cause 1:1 conduction in atrial flutter leading to ventricular fibrillation. 
Patients may develop idiosyncratic ventricular tachycardia with low levels, especially when

Quinidine is a substrate of CYP 450 3A3/4 and 3A5–7 enzymes, and an inhibitor of CYP 450 2D6 and 
3A3/4 enzymes. Can cause increase in digoxin levels. Quinidine potentiates the effect of neuro­
muscular blocking agents, beta blockers, anticholinergics, and warfarin. Amiodarone, antacids, 
delavirdine, diltiazem, grapefruit juice, saquinavir, ritonavir, verapamil, or cimetidine may enhance 
the drug’s effect. Barbiturates, phenytoin, cholinergic drugs, nifedipine, sucralfate, or rifampin 
may reduce quinidine’s effect. Use with caution in renal insufficiency (15%–25% of drug is 
eliminated unchanged in the urine), myocardial depression, sick sinus syndrome, G6PD deficiency, 
and hepatic dysfunction.
Therapeutic levels (antiarrhythmic): 3–7 mg/L. Recommended serum sampling times at steady 
state: trough level obtained within 30 min prior to the next scheduled dose after 1–2 days of 
continuous dosing (steady state).
MALARIA USE: Continuous monitoring of electrocardiogram, blood pressure, and serum glucose is 
recommended, especially in pregnant women and young children. 
QUINUPRISTIN AND DALFOPRISTIN
Synercid
Antibiotic, streptogramin
Injection: 500 mg (150 mg quinupristin and 350 mg dalfopristin)

Vancomycin-­resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF):
Child < 16 yr (limited data), ≥16 yr and adult: 7.5 mg/kg/dose IV Q 8 hr
Complicated skin infections:
Child < 16 yr (limited data), ≥16 yr and adult: 7.5 mg/kg/dose IV Q 12 hr for at least 7 days
VREF endocarditis:
Child and adult: 7.5 mg/kg/dose IV Q 8 hr for at least 8 weeks
Not active against Enterococcus faecalis. Use with caution in hepatic impairment; dosage 
reduction may be necessary. Most common side effects include pain, burning, 
inflammation and edema at the intravenous infusion site, thrombophlebitis, and 
thrombosis, GI disturbances, rash, arthralgia, myalgia, increased liver enzymes, 
hyperbilirubinemia, and headache. Dose frequency reductions (Q 8 hr–Q 12 hr) or 
discontinuation can improve severe cases of arthralgia and myalgia. Use total body weight 
for obese patients when calculating dosages.
Drug is an inhibitor to the CYP 450 3A4 isoenzyme. Avoid use with CYP 450 3A4 substrates, which 
can prolong QTc interval. May increase the effects/toxicity of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, 
delavirdine, nevirapine, indinavir, ritonavir, diazepam, midazolam, carbamazepine, methylpred­
nisolone, vinca alkaloids, docetaxel, paclitaxel, quinidine and some calcium channel blockers.
Pediatric (<16 yr old) pharmacokinetic studies are incomplete. Reduce dose for patients with 
hepatic cirrhosis (Child-­Pugh A or B).
Drug is compatible with D5W and incompatible with saline and heparin. Infuse each dose over 1 hr 
using the following max. IV concentrations: peripheral line: 2 mg/mL, central line: 5 mg/mL. If

collected in prechilled tubes containing heparin, and placed in an ice-­water bath to avoid potential 
falsely low uric acid levels (degradation of plasma uric acid occurs in the presence of rasburicase 
at room temperature). Centrifugation in a precooled centrifuge (4°C) is indicated. Plasma samples 
must be assayed within 4 hr of sample collection.

Contraindicated in IgA deficiency. Use with caution with history of atherosclerosis, known/
suspected hyperviscosity, coagulation disorders, and other thrombotic risks. Adverse 
events associated with ITP indication include headache, chills, fever and reduction in 
hemoglobin (due to the destruction of Rho[D] antigen-­positive red cells). Intravascular 
hemolysis resulting in anemia and renal insufficiency has been reported. May interfere 
with immune response to live virus vaccines (e.g., MMR, varicella).
Clinical response for ITP therapy requires monitoring of platelet counts, RBC, Hgb, and reticulocyte 
count. Rho(D)-­positive patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of intravascular 
hemolysis, anemia, and renal insufficiency.

ORAL RIBAVIRIN: Contraindicated in pregnancy, significant or unstable cardiac disease, 
autoimmune hepatitis, hepatic decompensation (Child-­Pugh score >6; class B or C), 
hemoglobinopathies, and creatinine clearance <50 mL/min. Use with caution in 
preexisting cardiac disease, pulmonary disease and sarcoidosis. Anemia (most common), 
insomnia, depression, irritability, and suicidal behavior (higher in adolescent and pediatric 
patients) have been reported with the oral route.
Combination therapy with peginterferon for Hep C is no longer recommended due to poor efficacy. 
Tinnitus, hearing loss, vertigo, severe hypertriglyceridemia, and homicidal ideation have been 
reported in combination with interferon. Pancytopenia has been reported in combination with 
interferon and azathioprine. Increased risk for hepatic decompensation with cirrhotic chronic hepa­
titis C patients treated with α interferons or with HIV coinfection receiving HAART and interferon 
alfa-­2a. Growth inhibition (delays in weight and height increases) was observed in children (5–17 
years old) receiving combination therapy for up to 48 weeks.
May decrease the effects of zidovudine, stavudine; and increase risk for lactic acidosis with nucleo­
side analogues. Reduce or discontinue dosage for toxicity as follows:
Patient with no cardiac disease:
Hgb < 10 g/dL and ≥8.5 g/dL:
Child: 12 mg/kg/dose PO once daily; may further reduce to 8 mg/kg/dose PO once daily
Adult: 600 mg PO once daily (capsules or solution) or 200 mg PO QAM and 400 mg PO QPM 
(tablets)
Hgb < 8.5 g/dL: Discontinue therapy permanently.
Patient with cardiac disease:
≥2 mg/dL decrease in Hgb during any 4-­week period during therapy:
Child: 12 mg/kg/dose PO once daily; may further reduce to 8 mg/kg/dose PO once daily 
(monitor weekly)
Adult: 600 mg PO once daily (capsules or solution) or 200 mg PO QAM and 400 mg PO QPM 
(tablets)
Hgb < 12 g/dL after 4 weeks of reduced dose: Discontinue therapy permanently
INHALED RIBAVIRIN: Use of ribavirin for RSV is controversial and not routinely indicated. Aerosol 
therapy may be considered for selected infants and young children at high risk for serious RSV 
disease (see most recent edition of the AAP Redbook). Most effective if begun early in course 
of RSV infection; generally in the first 3 days. May cause worsening respiratory distress, rash, 
conjunctivitis, mild bronchospasm, hypotension, anemia and cardiac arrest. Avoid unnecessary 
occupational exposure to ribavirin due to its teratogenic effects. Drug can precipitate in the 
respiratory equipment.

of skin and body fluids (brown-­orange color) and marrow suppression. Rash, eosinophilia, 
and bronchospasm have been reported. Use with caution in renal and liver impairment. 
Adjust dose in renal impairment (see Chapter 31). May permanently stain contact lenses. 
Uveitis can occur when using high doses (>300 mg/24 hr in adults) in combination with 
macrolide antibiotics.
Rifabutin is an inducer of CYP 450 3A enzyme and is structurally similar to rifampin (similar drug 
interactions, see Rifampin). Clarithromycin, fluconazole, itraconazole, nevirapine and protease 
inhibitors increase rifabutin levels. Efavirenz may decrease rifabutin levels. May decrease 
effectiveness of dapsone, delavirdine, nevirapine, amprenavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir,

Never use as monotherapy except when used for prophylaxis. Patients with latent tuberculosis 
infection should NOT be treated with rifampin and pyrazinamide because of the risk of severe 
liver injury. Use is NOT recommended in porphyria. Use with caution in diabetes.
May cause GI irritation, allergy, headache, fatigue, ataxia, muscle weakness, confusion, fever, hepatitis, 
transient LFT abnormalities, blood dyscrasias, interstitial nephritis, and elevated BUN and uric acid. 
Causes red discoloration of body secretions such as urine, saliva and tears (which can permanently 
stain contact lenses). Bleeding and vitamin K–dependent coagulation disorders have been reported.
Induces several hepatic enzymes and transporters (CYP 450 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4; UGT1A1, 
P-­glycoprotein, and OATP1B1/1B3), which may decrease plasma concentration of digoxin, corticoste­
roids, buspirone, benzodiazepines, fentanyl, calcium channel blockers, β blockers, cyclosporine, tacro­
limus, itraconazole, ketoconazole, oral anticoagulants, barbiturates, and theophylline. May reduce the 
effectiveness of oral contraceptives and anti-­retroviral agents (protease inhibitors and nonnucleoside 
reverse transcriptase inhibitors). Use is contraindicated with praziquantel due to decreased praziqu­
antel levels; rifampin should be discontinued 4 weeks prior to initiating praziquantel and rifampin 
can be restarted one day after completion of praziquantel. Hepatotoxicity is a concern when used in 
combination with pyrazinamide and ritonavir-­boosted saquinavir (use is contraindicated).
Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31). Reduce dose in hepatic impairment. Give oral doses 1 
hr before or 2 hr after meals.

IM: Start with 25 mg Q 2 wk; if no response, dose may be increased to 37.5 mg or 50 mg at 4-­week 
intervals. Max. IM dose: 50 mg Q 2 wk. PO risperidone should also be administered with the initial 
IM dose and continued × 3 weeks and discontinued to provide adequate plasma concentrations 
during the initial IM dosing period.
Use with caution in cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, renal or hepatic impairment (dose 
reduction necessary), hypothermia or hyperthermia, seizures, breast cancer or other prolactin 
dependent tumors, and dysphagia. Common side effects include abdominal pain and other 
GI disturbances, arthralgia, anxiety, dizziness, headache, insomnia, somnolence (use QHS 
dosing), EPS, cough, fever, pharyngitis, rash, rhinitis, sexual dysfunction, tachycardia, and 
weight gain. Weight gain, somnolence, and fatigue were common side effects reported in the 
autism studies. Priapism, QTc prolongation, hypothermia, sleep apnea syndrome, sleep 
walking, ileus, urinary retention, diabetes mellitus, and hypoglycemia have been reported in 
post marketing reports. Very rare cases of anaphylaxis have been reported with use of the IM 
dosage form in patients who have previously tolerated the oral dosage form.
In the presence of severe renal or hepatic impairment or risk for hypotension, the following adult 
dosing has been recommended: Start with 0.5 mg PO BID. Increase dose, if needed and tolerated, 
in increments no more than 0.5 mg BID. Increases to doses >1.5 mg BID should occur at intervals 
of at least 1 week; slower titration may be required in some patients.
Limited studies in pediatric related Tourette syndrome, schizophrenia, and aggressive behavior in 
psychiatric disorders are reported. Autistic disorder safety and efficacy in children <5 years of age 
have not been established. If therapy has been discontinued for a period of time, therapy should be 
reinitiated with the same initial titration regimen.
Drug is a CYP 450 2D6 and 3A4 isoenzyme substrate. Concurrent use of isoenzyme inhibitors (e.g., 
fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, cimetidine) and inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, rifampin, phe­
nobarbital, phenytoin) may increase and decrease the effects of risperidone, respectively. Alcohol, 
CNS depressants, and St. John’s wort may potentiate the drug’s side effect. Risperidone may 
enhance the hypotensive effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists.
Oral dosage forms may be administered with or without food. Oral solution can be mixed in water, 
coffee, orange juice, or low-­fat milk but is incompatible with cola or tea. Do not split or chew the 
orally disintegrating tablet. Use IM suspension preparation within 6 hr after reconstitution.

Use with caution in hepatic impairment and history of anaphylaxis with other neuromuscular 
blocking agents. Hypertension, hypotension, arrhythmia, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, 
bronchospasm, wheezing, hiccups, rash, and edema at the injection site may occur. Myopathy 
after long-­term use in an intensive care unit (ICU) and QT interval prolongation in pediatric 
patients receiving general anesthetic agents have been reported. Severe anaphylactic reactions 
and malignant hypothermia have been reported. Increased neuromuscular blockade may occur 
with concomitant use of aminoglycosides, clindamycin, tetracycline, magnesium sulfate, quinine, 
quinidine, succinylcholine and inhalation anesthetics (for continuous infusion, reduce infusion by 
30%–50% at 45–60 min after intubating dose).
Caffeine, calcium, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenylephrine, azathioprine, and theophylline may 
reduce neuromuscular blocking effects.
Use must be accompanied by adequate anesthesia or sedation. Peak effects occur in 0.5–1 min for 
children and in 1–3.7 min for adults. Duration of action: 30–40 min in children and 20–94 min in 
adults (longer in geriatrics). Recovery time in children 3 months to 1 year of age is similar to that in 
adults. To prevent residual paralysis, extubate patient only after the patient has sufficiently recovered 
from neuromuscular blockade. In obese patients, use actual body weight for dosage calculation.

SALMETEROL
Serevent Diskus
β-­2-­adrenergic agonist (long acting)
Dry powder inhalation (DPI; Diskus): 50 mCg/inhalation (28, 60 inhalations); contains lactose
In combination with fluticasone: see Fluticasone Propionate and Salmeterol
Persistent asthma (see remarks):
≥4 yr and adult: 1 inhalation (50 mCg) Q 12 hr
Prevention of exercise-­induced bronchospasm:
≥4 yr and adult: 1 inhalation 30 to 60 min before exercise. Additional does should not be used for 
another 12 hr. Patients who are already using 12-­hr dosing for persistent asthma should not use 
additional salmeterol doses for this indication and use alternative therapy (e.g., albuterol) prior to 
exercise.
For long-­term asthma control, should be used in combination with inhaled corticosteroids. 
Should not be used to relieve symptoms of acute asthma. It is long acting and has its 
onset of action in 10 to 20 min with a peak effect at 3 hr. May be used at QHS (1 
inhalation of the dry powder inhaler [DPI]) for nocturnal symptoms. Salmeterol is a chronic 
medication and is not used in similar fashion to short-­acting β agonists (e.g., albuterol). 
Patients already receiving salmeterol every 12 hr should not use additional doses for 
prevention of exercise-­induced bronchospasm; consider alternative therapy. Asthma 
exacerbations or hospitalizations were reported to be lower when this medication was used 
with an inhaled corticosteroid.
WARNING: Long-­acting β-­2-­agonists as monotherapy increase the risks of asthma-­related 
death and asthma-­related hospitalizations. Monotherapy without concomitant use of an inhaled 
corticosteroid is contraindicated in asthma. Use salmeterol only as additional therapy for patients 
not adequately controlled on other asthma-­controller medications (e.g., low-­ to medium-­dose 
inhaled corticosteroids) or whose disease severity clearly requires initiation of treatment with two 
maintenance therapies. Contraindicated in milk allergies; contains milk proteins.
Should not be used in conjunction with an inhaled, long-­acting β-­2 agonist and is not a substitute 
for inhaled or systemic corticosteroid. Use with strong CYP450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, 
HIV protease inhibitors, clarithromycin, itraconazole, nefazodone, and telithromycin) is not 
recommended due to risk for cardiovascular adverse events (e.g., QTc prolongation, tachycardia). 
Salmeterol is a CYP450 3A4 substrate.
Proper patient education is essential. Use with caution in hepatic impairment. Side effects are 
similar to those of albuterol. Hypertension and arrhythmias have been reported. See Chapter 24 for 
recommendations for asthma controller therapy.

patch 24 hr after surgery.
Antiemetic prior to cesarean section: Apply patch behind the ear 1 hr prior surgery to minimize 
infant exposure. Remove patch 24 hr after surgery.
Toxicities similar to those of atropine. Contraindicated in closed-­angle glaucoma and 
hypersensitivity to belladonna alkaloids. Use with caution in hepatic or renal dysfunction, 
GI and urinary disorders (discontinue use if there is difficulty in urination), cardiac 
disease, seizures, or psychosis. May cause dry mouth, drowsiness, and blurred vision. 
Generalized rash and erythema may indicate hypersensitivity to the medication or other 
ingredients in the formulation.
Transdermal route should NOT be used in children under 12 yr of age. Drug withdrawal symptoms 
(nausea, vomiting, headache, and vertigo) have been reported following removal of transdermal 
patch in patients using the patch for more than 3 days. For perioperative use, the patch should be 
kept in place for 24 hr following surgery.
Concurrent use with medications with known CNS adverse reactions or have anticholinergic proper­
ties may potentiate scopolamine’s CNS effects. Use of this medication may delay the rate of orally 
administered drugs and will interfere with the gastric secretion test (discontinue use 10 days prior 
to testing).

Depression (see remarks):
Child ≥6–12 yr (data limited in this age group): Start at 12.5–25 mg PO once daily. 
May increase dosage by 25 mg at weekly intervals up to a max. dose of 200 mg/24 hr.
Child ≥13 yr and adult: Start at 25–50 mg PO once daily. May increase dosage by 50 mg at 
weekly intervals up to a max. dose of 200 mg/24 hr.
Obesessive compulsive disorder (see remarks):
Child ≥6–12 yr: Start at 25 mg PO once daily. May increase dosage by 25 mg at 3-­ to 4-­day intervals 
or by 50 mg at 7-­day intervals up to a max. dose of 200 mg/24 hr.
Child ≥13 yr and adult: Start at 50 mg PO once daily. May increase dosage by 50 mg at weekly 
intervals up to max. dose of 200 mg/24 hr.
Drug is contraindicated in combination (or within 14 days of discontinuing use) with a 
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor (e.g., linezolid or intravenous methylene blue) or 
pimozide (increases adverse/toxic effects of pimozide). Use with caution in patients with 
abnormal bleeding, syndrome of inappropriate diuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion, and 
hepatic or renal impairment. Adverse effects include nausea, diarrhea, tremor, and 
increased sweating. Hyponatremia, diabetes mellitus, rhabdomyolysis, trismus, and 
platelet dysfunction have been reported. A positive correlation with length of QTc interval 
and serum sertraline and N-­desmethylsertraline levels has been reported.
Monitor for clinical worsening of depression and suicidal ideation/behavior following the initiation of 
therapy or after dose changes. Use during the late third trimester of pregnancy may increase risk 
for withdrawal symptoms and persistent pulmonary hypertension in the newborn.
Use with drugs that interfere with hemostasis (e.g., NSAIDs, aspirin, warfarin) may increase risk for 
GI bleeds. Use with warfarin may increase PT. Inhibits the CYP 450 2D6 drug metabolizing enzyme. 
Serotonin syndrome may occur when taken with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., 
amitriptyline, amphetamines, buspirone, dihydroergotamine, sumatriptan, sympathomimetics).
Sertraline is a substrate for CYP 450 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4. Poor metabolizers of CYP 450 
2C19 should initiate therapy at 50% of the recommended dosage and titrate to desired effect or 
consider using an alternative medication not predominantly metabolized by this enzyme. Ultrarapid 
2C19 metabolizers should initiate therapy at the recommended starting dose and titrate to the 
recommended maintenance dosage or consider using a drug not predominantly metabolized by 
this enzyme.
Do not abruptly discontinue use; gradually taper dose (4–6 wk has been recommended) to reduce risk 
for withdrawal symptoms.
Mix oral concentrate solution with 4 oz of water, ginger ale, lemon/lime soda, lemonade, or orange 
juice. After mixing, a slight haze may appear; this is normal. This dosage form should be used

Pulmonary hypertension:
Neonate (limited data from case reports and small clinical trials):
PO: Several dosages have been reported and have ranged from 0.5 to 3 mg/kg/dose 
Q 6–12 hr PO. A single dose of ∼0.3 mg/kg PO has been used in select patients to facilitate 
weaning from inhaled nitric oxide.
IV (case report from 4 neonates >34 wk gestation and <72 hr old): Start with 0.4 mg/kg/dose 
IV over 3 hr followed by a continuous infusion of 1.6 mg/kg/24 hr (0.067 mg/kg/hr) for up to 
7 days.
Infant and child (limited data):
PO: Start at 0.25 mg/kg/dose Q 6 hr or 0.5 mg/kg/dose Q 8 hr; if needed, titrate dose up to 
1–2 mg/kg/dose Q 6–8 hr. A single dose of ∼0.4mg/kg PO has been used in select patients to 
facilitate weaning from inhaled nitric oxide.
Child 1–17 yr (higher doses and long-­term use are associated with increased risk for mortality; 
see remarks).
PO:
≥8–20 kg: 10 mg TID
>20–45 kg: 20 mg TID
>45 kg: 40 mg TID
Pulmonary arterial hypertension:
Adult:
PO: 20 mg TID (take at least 4–6 hr apart)
IV: 10 mg TID
Contraindicated with concurrent use of nitrates (e.g., nitroglycerin) and other nitric oxide 
donors; potentiates hypotensive effects. Use with caution in sepsis (high levels of cGMP 
may potentiate hypotension), hypotension, sickle cell anemia (use not established) and 
with concurrent CYP 450 3A4 inhibiting medications (see discussion that follows) and 
anti-­hypertensive medications. Hepatic insufficiency or severe renal impairment 
(glomerular filtration rate [GFR] <30 mL/min) significantly reduces sildenafil clearance.
Findings from the dose-­ranging study in 1-­ to 17-­yr-­olds with pulmonary arterial hypertension found 
an association of increased mortality risk with long-­term use (>2 yr). Headache, pyrexia, upper 
respiratory tract infections (URTIs), vomiting, and diarrhea were the most frequently reported side 
effect in this study. Optimal dosing based on age and body weight still needs to be determined. 
Hazard ratios for mortality were 3.95 (95% CI: 1.46–10.65) for high versus low doses and 1.92 
(95% CI: 0.65–5.65) for medium versus low doses in follow-­up study for those receiving therapy for 
≥3 yr. A subsequent extension open-­label study on the same population for an additional 16 weeks 
reported a greater hazard ratio for mortality with high-­ versus low-­dose therapy (P = 0.007).
In adults, a transient impairment of color discrimination may occur; this effect could increase risk 
of severe retinopathy of prematurity in neonates. Common side effects reported in adults have 
included flushing, rash, diarrhea, indigestion, headache, abnormal vision, and nasal congestion. 
Hearing loss has been reported.
Sildenafil is substrate for CYP 450 3A4 (major) and 2C8/9 (minor). Azole antifungals, cimetidine, 
ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, nicardipine, propofol, protease inhibitors, quinidine, 
verapamil, and grapefruit juice may increase the effects/toxicity of sildenafil. Bosentin, efavirenz, 
carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin, St. John’s wort, and high-­fat meals may 
decrease sildenafil effects.

Increased susceptibility to infection and development of lymphoma may result from 
immunosuppression. Fatal bronchial anastomotic dehiscence has been reported in lung 
transplantation. Excess mortality, graft loss, and hepatic artery thrombosis have been 
reported in liver transplantation when used with tacrolimus. Patients with the greatest 
amount of urinary protein excretion prior to sirolimus conversion were those whose protein 
excretion increased the most after conversion. Increase risk of BK virus associated 
nephropathies have been reported. The following adverse effects have been reported when 
converting from a calcineurin inhibitor-­based regimen to maintenance sirolimus:
Stable liver transplant: increased mortality
Kidney transplant: pneumonia, proteinuria, acute rejection, graft loss and death.
Monitor whole-­blood trough levels (just prior to a dose at steady state); especially with pediatric 
patients; hepatic impairment; concurrent use of CYP 450 3A4 and/or P-­gp inducers and inhibitors; 
and/or if cyclosporine dosage is markedly changed or discontinued. Steady-­state is generally 
achieved after 5 to 7 days of continuous dosing. Interpretation will vary based on specific treat­
ment protocol and assay methodology (HPLC vs immunoassay vs LC/MS/MS). Younger children 
may exhibit faster sirolimus clearance compared with adolescents.
Sirolimus is a substrate for CYP 450 3A4 and P-­gp. Cyclosporine, diltiazem, protease inhibitors, 
erythromycin, grapefruit juice and other inhibitors of CYP 3A4 may increase the toxicity of siroli­
mus. Phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St John’s wort may decrease the effects of 
sirolimus. Strong inhibitors (e.g., azole antifungals and clarithromycin) and strong inducers (e.g., 
rifamycins) are not recommended.
Hypertension, peripheral edema, increase serum creatinine, dyspnea, epistaxis, headache, anemia, 
thrombocytopenia, hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, and arthralgia may occur. Progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), diabetes mellitus, posterior reversible encephalopathy 
syndrome, ovarian cysts and menstrual disorders have been reported. Urinary tract infections have 
been reported in pediatric renal transplant patients with high immunologic risk.
Two milligrams of the oral solution have been demonstrated to be clinically equivalent to the 2-­mg 
tablets. However, it is not known whether they are still therapeutically equivalent at higher 
doses. Reduce maintenance dosage by one-­third in the presence of hepatic function impairment. 
Administer doses consistently with or without food. When administered with cyclosporine, give 
dose 4 hr after cyclosporine. Do not crush or split tablets. Measure the oral liquid dosage form 
with an amber oral syringe and dilute in a cup with 60 mL of water or orange juice only. Take dose 
immediately after mixing, add/mix additional 120 mL diluent into the cup, and drink immediately 
after mixing.

Correction of metabolic acidosis: Calculate patient’s dose with the following formulas.
Neonate, infant and child:
HCO3− (mEq) = 0.3× weight (kg) × base deficit (mEq/L), OR
HCO3− (mEq) = 0.5× weight (kg) × [24 – serum HCO3− (mEq/L)]
Adult:
HCO3− (mEq) = 0.2× weight (kg) × base deficit (mEq/L), OR
HCO3− (mEq) = 0.5× weight (kg) × [24 – serum HCO3− (mEq/L)]
Urinary alkalinization (titrate dose accordingly to urine pH):
Child: 84–840 mg (1–10 mEq)/kg/24 hr PO ÷ QID
Adult: 4 g (48 mEq) × 1 followed by 1–2 g (12–24 mEq) PO Q4 hr. Doses up to 16 g (192 mEq)/
24 hr have been used.
Contraindicated in respiratory alkalosis, hypochloremia, and inadequate ventilation during 
cardiac arrest. Use with caution in congestive heart failure (CHF), renal impairment, 
cirrhosis, hypocalcemia, hypertension, and concurrent corticosteroids. Maintain high urine 
output. Monitor acid-­base balance and serum electrolytes. May cause hypernatremia 
(contains sodium), hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hyperreflexia, edema, 
and tissue necrosis (extravasation). Oral route of administration may cause GI discomfort 
and gastric rupture from gas production.
For direct intravenous administration (cardiac arrest) in neonates and infants, use the 0.5 mEq/
mL (4.2 %) concentration or dilute the 1 mEq/mL (8.4 %) concentration 1:1 with sterile water for 
injection and infuse at a rate no greater than 10 mEq/min. The 1 mEq/mL (8.4 %) concentration 
may be used in children and adults for direct intravenous administration.
For intravenous infusions (for all ages), dilute to a max. concentration of 0.5 mEq/mL in dextrose or 
sterile water for injection and infuse over 2 hr using a max. rate of 1 mEq/kg per hr.
Sodium bicarbonate should not be mixed with or be in contact with calcium, norepinephrine or 
dobutamine.

Contraindicated in Addison disease, hyperkalemia, use with eplerenone, or severe renal 
failure (see Chapter 31). Use with caution in dehydration, hyponatremia, and renal or 
hepatic dysfunction. Precipitation of impaired neurologic function, worsening hepatic 
encephalopathy, and coma may occur with hepatic disease with cirrhosis and ascites. May 
cause hyperkalemia (especially with severe heart failure), GI distress, rash, lethargy, 
dizziness, and gynecomastia. May potentiate ganglionic blocking agents and other 
antihypertensives. Monitor potassium levels and be aware of other K+ sources, K+-­sparing 
diuretics and angiotensin-­converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEIs] (all of which can increase 
K+).
Do not use with other medications known to cause hyperkalemia (e.g., ACEIs, angiotensin II antago­
nists, aldosterone blockers, and other potassium-­sparing diuretics). Hyperkalemic metabolic 
acidosis has been reported with concurrent cholestyramine use. May cause false elevation in serum 
digoxin levels measured by radioimmunoassay.

IM: 3–4 mg/kg/dose ×1; max. dose: 150 mg/dose
Maintenance for long surgical procedures: 0.04–0.07 mg/kg/dose IV Q 5–10 min PRN. 
Continuous infusion not recommended.
Contraindicated after the acute phase of an injury following major burns, multiple trauma, 
extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury because severe 
hyperkalemia and subsequent cardiac arrest may occur. Individuals carrying the RYR1 or 
CACNA1S gene have an increased risk for developing malignant hyperthermia with 
succinylcholine or halogenated volatile anesthetics; use in these individuals is 
contraindicated. Succinylcholine should be avoided in patients who are susceptible to 
malignant hyperthermia.
Pretreatment with atropine is recommended to reduce incidence of bradycardia. For rapid sequence 
intubation, see Chapter 1.
Cardiac arrest has been reported in children and adolescents primarily with skeletal muscle myopathies 
(e.g., Duchenne muscular dystrophy). Identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy prior to 
use. Predose creatine kinase may be useful for identifying patients at risk. Monitoring of the electro­
cardiogram (ECG) for peaked T waves may be useful in detecting early signs of this adverse effect.
May cause malignant hyperthermia (use dantrolene to treat), bradycardia, hypotension, arrhythmia, 
and hyperkalemia. Severe anaphylactic reactions have been reported; use caution if previous 
anaphylactic reaction to other neuromuscular blocking agents. Use with caution in patients 
with severe burns, paraplegia, or crush injuries and in patients with preexisting hyperkalemia. 
Beware of prolonged depression in patients with liver disease, malnutrition, pseudocholinesterase 
deficiency, hypothermia and those receiving aminoglycosides, phenothiazines, quinidine, β block­
ers, amphotericin B, cyclophosphamide, diuretics, lithium, acetylcholine, and anticholinesterases. 
Diazepam may decrease neuromuscular blocking effects. Prior use of succinylcholine may enhance 
the neuromuscular blocking effect of vecuronium and its duration of action.
Duration of action 4–6 min IV, 10–30 min IM. Must be prepared to intubate within 1 min.

Contraindicated in patients with sulfonamide or trimethoprim hypersensitivity and megaloblastic 
anemia due to folate deficiency. May cause kernicterus in newborns; may cause blood dyscrasias, 
crystalluria, glossitis, renal or hepatic injury, GI irritation, rash, Stevens-­Johnson syndrome, 
or hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency. Severe hyponatremia may occur during 
treatment of Pneumocystic jiroveci pneumonia. Hyperkalemia may appear in HIV/AIDS patients. 
Use with caution in renal and hepatic impairment and in G6PD deficiency. QT prolongation 
resulting in ventricular tachycardia has been reported. Slow acetylators may be prone to 
idiosyncratic reactions to sulfonamides. Intravenous dosage form contains propylene glycol and 
benzyl alcohol, which may result in adverse toxic effects when used at igher dosages, especially 
in neonates. Use of an adjusted body weight ([ABW] ABW = ideal body weight + 0.4 × [total body 
weight − ideal body weight]) has been recommended for determining doses for obese patients.
Epidemiologic studies suggest that use during pregnancy may be associated with increase risk of 
congenital malformations (particularly neural tube defects), cardiovascular malformations, urinary 
tract defects, oral clefts, and club foot.
Sulfamethoxazole is a CYP 450 2C9 substrate and inhibitor. Trimethoprim is a CYP 450 2C9, 3A4 
substrate and 2C8/9 inhibitor. Reduce dose in renal impairment (see Chapter 31).

Common adverse effects include cyanosis, airway obstruction, bradycardia, reflux of 
surfactant into the endotracheal (ET) tube, requirement for manual ventilation, and 
reintubation. Monitor O2 saturation and lung compliance after each dose such that oxygen 
therapy and ventilator pressure are adjusted as necessary.
All doses administered intratracheally via a 5-­french feeding catheter. If suspension settles during 
storage, gently swirl the contents; do not shake. Drug is stored in the refrigerator, protected from 
light, and does not need to be warmed before administration. Unopened vials that have been 
warmed to room temperature (once only) may be refrigerated within 24 hr and stored for future use.
For rescue therapy, repeat doses may be administered as early as 6 hr after the previous dose for a 
total of up to four doses if the infant is still intubated and requires at least 30% inspired oxygen to 
maintain a PaO2 ≥80 torr.

infant with either the right or left side dependent. After the first aliquot is administered, remove the 
catheter from the ET tube and manually ventilate the infant with 100% oxygen at a rate of 40–60 
breaths/min for 1 min. When the infant is stable, reposition the infant and administer the second 
dose with the same procedures. Then remove the catheter without flushing.
Currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment (rescue 
therapy) of RDS. Transient episodes of bradycardia, decreased oxygen saturation, reflux of 
surfactant into the ET tube, and airway obstruction have occurred during dose 
administration. Monitor O2 saturation and lung compliance after each dose and adjust 
oxygen therapy and ventilator pressure as necessary. Pulmonary hemorrhage has been 
reported.
All doses administered intratracheally via a 5-­french feeding catheter. Suction infant prior to admin­
istration and 1 hr after surfactant instillation (unless signs of significant airway obstruction).
Drug is stored in the refrigerator and protected from light. Each vial of drug should be slowly warmed

Tacrolimus is a substrate of the CYP 450 3A4 drug metabolizing enzyme and Pgp transporter. A 1.5–
2-­fold higher initial standard dose up to a max. dose of 0.3 mg/kg/24 hr has been recommended 
for intermediate or extensive metabolizers for CYP 450 3A5. Calcium channel blockers, imidazole 
antifungals (ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, clotrimazole, posaconazole), macrolide antibi­
otics (erythromycin, clarithromycin, troleandomycin), cisapride, cimetidine, cyclosporine, danazol, 
herbal products containing schisandra sphenanthera extracts, methylprednisolone, grapefruit 
juice, seville oranges, and severe diarrhea can increase tacrolimus serum levels. In contrast, 
carbamazepine, caspofungin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin, rifabutin, and sirolimus may 
decrease levels. Use with sirolimus may increase risk for hepatic artery thrombosis. Avoid use of 
live attenuated vaccines. Use with other CYP 450 3A inhibitors and substrates has the potential to 
prolong the cardiac QT interval. Reduce dose in renal or hepatic insufficiency.
Monitor trough levels (just prior to a dose at steady state). Steady state is generally achieved after 
2–5 days of continuous dosing. Interpretation will vary based on treatment protocol and assay 
methodology (whole blood ELISA vs. MEIA vs. HPLC). Whole blood trough concentrations of 5–20 
ng/mL have been recommended in liver transplantation at 1–12 mo. Trough levels of 7–20 ng/
mL (whole blood) for the first 3 mo and 5–15 ng/mL after 3 mo have been recommended in renal 
transplantation. African Americans may need to be titrated to higher dosages.
Tacrolimus therapy generally should be initiated 6 hr or more after transplantation. PO is the 
preferred route of administration and all PO dosage forms should be administered on an empty 
stomach (1 hr before and 2 hr after meals).
Astagraf XL (extended release capsule): Safety and efficacy has been established for de novo and 
stable (receiving immediate-­release dosage form) pediatric kidney transplant patients. A mg per 
mg conversion from immediate release dosage form to Astagraf XL has been recommended.
Envarsus XR (extended release tablet): Currently labeled for use in adult kidney transplant patients 
(de novo and stable on immediate-­release tacrolimus). When converting to Envarsus XR from 
immediate-­release dosage form, initiate at 80% of the established immediate-­release dosage 
form.
All extended-­release formulations are NOT interchangeable. IV infusions should be administered at 
concentrations between 0.004 and 0.02 mg/mL diluted with NS or D5W.
TOPICAL USE: Not recommended for use in patients with skin conditions with a skin barrier defect 
with the potential for systemic absorption. Do not use in children <2 yr, immunocompromised 
patients, or with occlusive dressings (promotes systemic absorption). Approved as a second-­line 
therapy for short-­term and intermittent treatment of atopic dermatitis for patients who fail to 
respond, or do not tolerate, other approved therapies. Long-­term safety is unknown. Skin burn sen­
sation, pruritus, flu-­like symptoms, allergic reaction, skin erythema, headache, and skin infection 
are the most common side effects. Application site edema has been reported. Although the risk is 
uncertain, the FDA has issued an alert about the potential cancer risk with the use of this product.

thrombotic microangiopathy, and liver failure (some fatal) have been reported. Monitor 
AST/ALT at baseline and repeat with CBC if therapy is >6 wk. Signs and symptoms of liver 
disease may include persistent nausea, anorexia, fatigue, vomiting, right upper abdominal 
pain, or jaundice. Discontinue use immediately if biochemical or clinical evidence of liver 
injury develops.
Use with caution in renal impairment as terbinafine’s clearance has been shown to decrease by 
∼50% in adults with CrCl ≤50 mL/min. Terbinafine inhibits CYP 450 2D6, thus increasing the 
effects/toxicity of 2D6 substrates such as amphetamines, risperidone, and fluoxetine.
Doses may be administered with or without food.
TOPICAL USE: Do not use on/in the eyes, mouth, nails, scalp, or vaginal areas. Local irritation, skin 
rash, xeroderma, pruritus, and contact dermatitis may occur. Apply to clean and dry affected area, 
and wash hands after each use. If using topical spray, hold spray 4–6 inches from the affected 
area during dose administration.

Use of the IV and PO route should not be used for the prevention or prolonged treatment 
of preterm labor because of the potential for serious maternal cardiac events and even 
death. Nervousness, tremor, headache, nausea, tachycardia, arrhythmias and palpitations 
may occur. Paradoxical bronchoconstriction may occur with excessive use; if it occurs, 
discontinue drug immediately. Injectable product may be used for nebulization. For acute 
asthma, nebulizations may be given more frequently than Q4–6 hr.
Monitor heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and serum potassium when using the continuous 
IV infusion route of administration. Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31). 
TETRACYCLINE HCL
Various generics; previously available as Sumycin
Antibiotic
Caps: 250, 500 mg
Oral suspension: 25 mg/mL 
Do not use in children <8 yr.

Acne: 500 mg PO BID
Adult: 250–500 mg PO Q6–12 hr
Not recommended in patients <8 yr owing to tooth staining and decreased bone growth. 
Also not recommended for use in pregnancy because these side effects may occur in the 
fetus. The risk for these adverse effects is highest with long-­term use. May cause nausea, 
GI upset, hepatotoxicity, stomatitis, rash, fever, and superinfection. Photosensitivity 
reaction may occur. Avoid prolonged exposure to sunlight.
Never use outdated tetracyclines because they may cause Fanconi-­like syndrome. Do not give with 
dairy products or with any divalent cations (i.e., Fe2+, Ca2+, Mg2+). Give 1 hr before or 2 hr after meals.
May decrease the effectiveness of oral contraceptives, increase serum digoxin levels, and increase 
effects of warfarin. Use with methoxyflurane increases risk for nephrotoxicity and use with isotreti­
noin is associated with pseudotumor cerebri. Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31).
Short-­term maternal use is not likely to cause harm to breast-­feeding infants.

Common side effects include headache, nausea, sinus congestion, and dizziness. Increased liver 
enzymes and cataracts may occur; monitor baseline AST/ALT and ocular exam at baseline. Repeat 
AST/ALT every 3 months for the first year followed by annual assessments. Repeat ocular exams 
annually. May cause a false positive urine drug screen for cannabinoids.
Use with caution with CrCl ≤30 mL/min and ESRD. Reduce dose with moderate/severe hepatic 
impairment or when initiating therapy while taking a CYP 450 3A4 inhibitor (see dosing section).
Tezacaftor and ivacaftor are substrates for CYP 450 3A4/3A5. Use with strong CYP 450 3A induc­
ers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, St. John’s wort) is not 
recommended. Tezacaftor and ivacaftor may increase the effects/toxicity of cyclosporine, digoxin, 
everolimus, sirolimus, tacrolimus, and warfarin. Always evaluate potential drug-­drug interactions; 
see https://www.symdekohcp.com/drug-­interactions. Avoid food or drink containing grapefruit or 
Seville oranges.
Administer all doses with high-­fat foods to assure absorption. If a dose (all dosage forms) is missed 
within 6 hrs of a scheduled dose, administer a dose immediately. However, if the missed dose is 
>6 hr, skip that dose and resume therapy at the next scheduled dose. Never take a double dose for 
a missed dose.

Maintenance, child >1 yr and adult without risk factors for altered clearance (see remarks):
<45 kg: Begin therapy at 12–14 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q4–6 hr up to max. dose of 300 mg/24 hr. If 
needed based on serum levels, gradually increase to 16–20 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q4–6 hr. Max. dose: 
600 mg/24 hr.
≥45 kg: Begin therapy with 300 mg/24 hr ÷ Q6–8 hr. If needed based on serum levels, gradually 
increase to 400–600 mg/24 hr ÷ Q6–8 hr.
Drug metabolism varies widely with age, drug formulation, and route of administration. Most 
common side effects and toxicities are nausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, 
gastroesophageal reflux, nervousness, tachycardia, seizures, and arrhythmias.
Serum levels should be monitored. Therapeutic levels: bronchospasm: 10–20 mg/L; apnea: 7–13 
mg/L. Half-­life is age-­dependent: 30 hr (newborns); 6.9 hr (infants); 3.4 hr (children); 8.1 hr 
(adults). See Aminophylline for guidelines for serum level determinations. Liver impairment, 
cardiac failure, and sustained high fever may increase theophylline levels. Theophylline is a 
substrate for CYP 450 1A2. Levels are increased with allopurinol, alcohol, ciprofloxacin, cimetidine, 
clarithromycin, disulfiram, erythromycin, estrogen, isoniazid, propranolol, thiabendazole, and 
verapamil. Levels are decreased with carbamazepine, isoproterenol, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and 
rifampin. May cause increased skeletal muscle activity, agitation, and hyperactivity when used 
with doxapram, and increase quinine levels/toxicity.
Use ideal body weight in obese patients when calculating dosage because of poor distribution into 
body fat. Risk factors for increased clearance include: smoking, cystic fibrosis, hyperthyroidism, 
and high-­protein diet. Factors for decreased clearance include CHF, correction of hyperthyroidism, 
fever, viral illness, sepsis, and high carbohydrate diet.

THIORIDAZINE
Various generics, previously available as Mellaril
Antipsychotic, phenothiazine derivative
Tabs: 10, 25, 50, 100 mg
Schizophrenia:
Child ≥6 yr–adolescent: Start with 0.5 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ BID–TID (initial max.: 50 mg/dose); 
dosage range: 0.5–3 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ BID–TID. Max. dose: 3 mg/kg/24 hr.
Adult: Start with 75–300 mg/24 hr PO ÷ TID. Then gradually increase PRN to max. dose 
800 mg/24 hr ÷ BID–QID.
Indicated for schizophrenia unresponsive to standard therapy. Contraindicated in severe CNS 
depression, brain damage, narrow-­angle glaucoma, blood dyscrasias, and severe liver or 
cardiovascular disease. DO NOT co-­administer with drugs which may inhibit the CYP 450 2D6 
isoenzymes (e.g., SSRIs such as fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine; and beta-­blockers such 
as propranolol and pindolol); drugs which may widen the QTc interval (e.g., disopyramide, 
procainamide, quinidine); and in patients with known reduced activity of CYP 450 2D6.
May cause drowsiness, extrapyramidal reactions, autonomic symptoms, ECG changes (QTc 
prolongation in a dose-­dependent manner), arrhythmias, paradoxical reactions, and endocrine 
disturbances. Long-­term use may cause tardive dyskinesia. Pigmentary retinopathy may occur with 
higher doses; a periodic eye exam is recommended. More autonomic symptoms and less extra­
pyramidal effects than chlorpromazine. Concurrent use with epinephrine can cause hypotension. 
Increased cardiac arrhythmias may occur with tricyclic antidepressants.
In an overdose situation, monitor ECG and avoid drugs that can widen QTc interval.

at 4-­wk intervals to 0.5, 1, and 1.5 mg/kg/24 hr until an effective and well-­tolerated dose was 
established. Criteria for dose increase required tolerance of the current dosage level and <50% 
reduction in seizures. Patients receiving enzyme-­inducing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) received a 
max. daily dose of 0.73 + 0.44 mg/kg/24 hr and patients receiving non-­enzyme inducing AEDs

Adjunctive therapy for partial seizures (dosage based on use with enzyme-­inducing AEDs; see 
remarks). NOTE: Patients receiving non-­enzyme-­inducing AEDs had tiagabine blood levels about two 
times higher than patients receiving enzyme-­inducing AEDs.
≥12 yr and adult: Start at 4 mg PO once daily × 7 days. If needed, increase dose to 8 mg/24 hr PO 
÷ BID. Dosage may be increased further by 4–8 mg/24 hr at weekly intervals (daily doses may be 
divided BID–QID) until a clinical response is achieved or up to specified max. dose.
Max. dose:
12–18 yr: 32 mg/24 hr
Adult: 56 mg/24 hr
Use with caution in hepatic insufficiency (may need to reduce dose and/or increase dosing 
interval). Most common side effects include dizziness, somnolence, depression, confusion, 
and asthenia. Nervousness, tremor, nausea, abdominal pain, confusion, and difficulty in 
concentrating may also occur. Cognitive/neuropsychiatric symptoms resulting in 
nonconvulsive status epilepticus requiring subsequent dose reduction or drug 
discontinuation have been reported. Suicidal behavior or ideation, bullous dermatitis, and 
blurred vision have been reported. Off-­label use in patients WITHOUT epilepsy is 
discouraged due to reports of seizures in these patients.
Tiagabine’s clearance is increased by concurrent hepatic enzyme-­inducing antiepileptic drugs (e.g., 
phenytoin, carbamazepine, and barbiturates), and St. John’s Wort. Lower doses or a slower titration 
for clinical response may be necessary for patients receiving non-­enzyme-­inducing drugs (e.g., 
valproate, gabapentin, and lamotrigine). Avoid abrupt discontinuation of drug.
TID dosing schedule may be preferred since BID schedule may not be well tolerated. Doses should be 
administered with food.

dermatologic reactions including exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, 
erythema multiforme, and Stevens-­Johnson syndrome have been reported rarely. Ototoxic 
effects synergistic with furosemide.
Higher doses are recommended in patients with cystic fibrosis, neutropenia, or burns. Adjust dose in 
renal failure (see Chapter 31). Monitor peak and trough levels.
Therapeutic peak levels with conventional Q8 hr dosing:
6–10 mg/L in general
8–10 mg/L in pulmonary infections, neutropenia, osteomyelitis, and severe sepsis
Therapeutic trough levels with conventional Q8 hr dosing: <2 mg/L. Recommended serum sampling 
time at steady state: trough within 30 min prior to the third consecutive dose and peak 30–60 min 
after the administration of the third consecutive dose.
Therapeutic peak and trough goals for high-­dose extended-­interval dosing for cystic fibrosis:
Peak: 20–40 mg/L; recommended serum sampling time at 30–60 min after the administration of 
the first dose.
Trough: <1 mg/L; recommended serum sampling time within 30 min before the second dose.
Serum levels should be rechecked with changing renal function, poor clinical response, and at a 
minimum of once weekly for prolonged therapies.
To maximize bactericidal effects, an individualized peak concentration to target a peak/MIC ratio of 
8–10:1 may be applied.
For initial dosing in obese patients, use an adjusted body weight (ABW). ABW = Ideal Body Weight + 
0.4 (Total Body Weight – Ideal Body Weight).

Use clinical outcome to guide dose and titration. Longer intervals between dose adjustments can be used.
Use with caution in renal and hepatic dysfunction (decreased clearance) and sulfa 
hypersensitivity. Reduce dose by 50% when creatinine clearance is <70 mL/min. 
Common side effects (incidence lower in children) include ataxia, cognitive dysfunction, 
dizziness, nystagmus, paresthesia, sedation, visual disturbances, nausea, dyspepsia, and 
kidney stones (incidence higher in children). Secondary angle closure glaucoma 
characterized by ocular pain, acute myopia, and increased intraocular pressure has been 
reported and may lead to blindness if left untreated. Patients should be instructed to seek 
immediate medical attention if they experience blurred vision or periorbital pain. 
Oligohidrosis and hyperthermia has been reported primarily in children and should be 
monitored especially during hot weather and with use of drugs that predispose patients to 
heat-­related disorders (e.g., carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and anticholinergics). Low 
serum bicarbonate levels have been reported in pediatric and adult clinical trials. 
Hyperchloremic, non-­anion gap metabolic acidosis, hyperammonemia (with or without

Drug is metabolized by and inhibits the CYP 450 2C19 isoenzyme. Phenytoin, valproic acid, and 
carbamazepine may decrease topiramate levels. Topiramate may decrease valproic acid, digoxin, 
warfarin, and ethinyl estradiol (to decrease oral contraceptive efficacy) but may increase phenytoin 
levels/effects. Alcohol and CNS depressants may increase CNS side effects. Carbonic anhydrase 
inhibitors (e.g., acetazolamide) may increase risk of metabolic acidosis, nephrolithiasis, or pares­
thesia. Use with valproic acid may result in the development of hyperammonemia.
Safety and efficacy in migraine prophylaxis in pediatrics have not been established; an increase in 
serum creatinine has been reported in a clinical trial.
Qudexy XR and Trokendi XR are not bioequivalent and should not be interchanged. Doses may be 
administered with or without food. Capsule may be opened and sprinkled on small amount of food 
(e.g., 1 teaspoonful of applesauce) and swallowed whole (do not chew). Maintain adequate hydra­
tion to prevent kidney stone formation. If discontinuing therapy, gradually taper dosage. 
TRAZODONE
Generics, previously available as Desyrel
Antidepressant, serotonin reuptake inhibitor/antagonist,

Tabs: 50, 100, 150, 300 mg
Oral suspension: 10 mg/mL 
Insomnia with comorbid psychiatric disorders (limited data):
18 mo to <3 yr: Start at 25 mg PO QHS. If needed, increase by 25 mg Q2 week up to 
a max. of 100 mg/24 hr.
3–5 yr: Start at 50 mg PO QHS, if needed, increase by 25 mg Q2 week up to a max. of 150 mg/24 hr.
5 yr–adolescent: 25–50 mg PO QHS, if needed, increase by 25–50 mg Q2 week up to a max. of 200 
mg/24 hr. Daily dose may be divided BID–TID when used for palliative care.
Use with caution in pre-­existing cardiac disease, initial recovery phase of MI, in patients 
receiving antihypertensive medications, renal and hepatic impairment (has not been 
evaluated), and electroconvulsive therapy. Common side effects include dizziness, 
drowsiness, dry mouth, and diarrhea. May cause angle-­closure glaucoma in patients with 
anatomically narrow angles who do not have an iridectomy. Seizures, tardive dyskinesia, 
EPS, arrhythmias, priapism, blurred vision, neuromuscular weakness, anemia, orthostatic 
hypotension, and rash have been reported. Monitor for clinical worsening of depression and 
suicidal ideation/behavior following the initiation of therapy or after dose changes.
Trazodone is CYP 450 3A4 isoenzyme substrate (may interact with inhibitors and inducers) and may 
increase digoxin levels and increase CNS effects of alcohol, barbiturates, and other CNS depres­
sants. Max. antidepressant effect is seen at 2–6 wk.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH):
IV/SC infusion:
Child (limited data): Initial dose of 2 nanogram/kg/min has been recommended with careful 
titration. Stable doses have been reported at 50–80 nanogram/kg/min with an unknown 
maximum dosage. Dosages as high as 350 and 170 nanogram/kg/min have been reported 
with the SC and IV routes, respectively.
Adult: Start at 1.25 nanogram/kg/min. If not tolerated, reduce to 0.625 nanogram/kg/min. If needed, 
increase dose at increments of 1.25 nanogram/kg/min per week for the first 4 wk followed by 2.5 
nanogram/kg/min per week thereafter. Limited experience with doses >40 nanogram/kg/min.
Inhalation:
Child (limited data): 1–9 (6–54 mCg) patient-­activated breaths Q6 hr. A retrospective report of 29 chil­
dren with PAH receiving background therapy initially received 3 breaths (18 mCg) via oral inhalation 
QID and titrated doses weekly as tolerated to a maximum of 9 breaths (54 mCg) QID for ≥6 wk. 19 of 
29 children had WHO functional class improvement (significant improvements in exercise tolerance 
and peak oxygen consumption). Four children had to discontinue therapy for reasons of O2 desatura­
tion (1), progression of PAH (1), and chest tightness with bronchospasms (2).
Adult: Start at 3 breaths (18 mCg) via oral inhalation Q4 hr four times a day during waking hours. 
Reduce dose to 1 or 2 breaths if not tolerated and subsequently increase to 3 breaths. If tolerated, 
increase dose by 3 additional inhalations at ∼1–2 wk intervals to the target and maximum mainte­
nance dose of 9 breaths (54 mCg) QID.
Use with caution in liver or renal impairment by titrating doses slowly. Avoid use with the 
oral dosage form in Child-­Pugh class B and C. Treprostinil is primarily metabolized by the 
liver via CYP 450 2C8 and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the urinary route. 
Inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) and inducers (e.g., rifampin) may increase and decrease 
treprostinil effects, respectfully.
Flushing, muscle pain (especially with SC route), headaches, and diarrhea are common side effects with 
injectable routes. Central line gram-­negative catheter infections have been reported with the IV route. 
Recommendations for reducing this risk include using watertight seals in the drug delivery system and 
closed-­hub systems, replacing the diluent with the diluent used for epoprostenol, and using the SC route. 
Thrombocytopenia has been reported with SC administration. Worsening of reactive airway symptoms, 
cough, dizziness, bone pain, headache, syncope, and flushing may occur with the inhaled route. Headache, 
diarrhea, nausea, and flushing are common side effects with the oral dosage form in clinical trials.
Treprostinil has a longer T1/2 than epoprostenol with better room temperature stability (depending on 
specific diluent used).
Do not abruptly withdrawal therapy and have a backup plan for interruptions with IV/SC continuous 
therapies (e.g., backup pumps and medications).

INJECTABLE USE: Anaphylaxis has been reported with use of the injectable dosage form. Dosage 
adjustment for hepatic failure with systemic use may be necessary. Triamcinolone is a substrate 
of the CYP 450 3A4 enzyme; inhibitors of this enzyme may increase risk for side effects. Use with 
caution in thyroid dysfunction, respiratory TB, ocular herpes simplex, peptic ulcer disease, osteopo­
rosis, hypertension, CHF, myasthenia gravis, ulcerative colitis, and renal dysfunction. With systemic 
use, pregnancy category changes to “D” if used in the first trimester. Avoid IV administration with 
injectable dosage forms. Injectable forms contain benzyl alcohol. 
TRIAMTERENE
Dyrenium and generics
Diuretic, potassium sparing
Caps: 50, 100 mg
Hypertension:
Child: 1–2 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ BID. May increase up to a max. of 3–4 mg/kg/24 hr up to 
300 mg/24 hr.
Adult: 50–100 mg/24 hr ÷ once daily–BID PO; max. dose: 300 mg/24 hr.
Do not use if GFR <10 mL/hr or in severe hepatic disease. Adjust dose in renal impairment 
(see Chapter 31) and cirrhosis. Monitor serum electrolytes. May cause hyperkalemia, 
hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, and metabolic acidosis. Interstitial nephritis, 
thrombocytopenia, and anaphylaxis have been reported.
Concurrent use of ACE inhibitors may increase serum potassium. Use with caution when administer­
ing medications with high potassium load (e.g., some penicillins) and in patients with hepatic 
impairment or on high potassium diets. Cimetidine may increase effects. This drug is also avail­
able as a combination product with hydrochlorothiazide; erythema multiforme and toxic epidermal 
necrolysis have been reported with this combination product. Administer doses with food to 
minimize GI upset. Pregnancy category changes to “D” if used in pregnancy-­induced hypertension. 
TRIFLURIDINE
Generics; previously available as Viroptic
Antiviral, ophthalmic
Ophthalmic solution: 1% (7.5 mL); contains thimerosal
Herpes keratoconjunctivitis:
≥6 yr, adolescent and adult: Instill 1 drop into affected eye(s) Q2 hr while awake up to 
a maximum of 9 drops/24 hr. Reduce dose when there is re-­epithelialization of the corneal ulcer 
to 1 drop Q4 hr (minimum 5 drops/24 hr) × 7 days. If improvement does not occur in 7–14 days, 
consider alternative therapy. DO NOT EXCEED 21 days of treatment.
Burning sensation in eyes and palpebral edema are common side effects. Rare cross 
sensitivity with idoxuridine, increased intraocular pressure, keratoconjunctivitis, and ocular 
hyperemia have been reported.
Avoid touching the applicator tip to eye, fingers, or other surfaces, and do not wear contact lenses 
during treatment of ocular infections. Apply pressure to the lacrimal sac during and for 1–2 min 
after dose administration to reduce risk of systemic absorption.
Store medication in the refrigerator (2–8°C). Storage at room temperature will result in a decrease in 
pH to cause stinging and ocular discomfort when in use.

This pro-­drug is metabolized to acyclovir and L-­valine with better oral absorption than 
acyclovir. Use with caution in hepatic or renal insufficiency (adjust dose; see Chapter 
31). Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS) has been 
reported in patients with advanced HIV infection and in bone marrow and renal transplant 
recipients. Probenecid or cimetidine can reduce the rate of conversion to acyclovir. 
Headache, nausea, and abdominal pain are common adverse events in adults. Headache 
is common in children. See Acyclovir for additional drug interactions and adverse effects.
For initial episodes of genital herpes, therapy is most effective when initiated within 48 hr of 
symptom onset. Therapy should be initiated immediately after the onset of symptoms in recurrent 
episodes (no efficacy data when initiating therapy >24 hr after onset of symptoms). Data are not 
available for use as suppressive therapy for periods >1 yr.

Contraindicated with hypersensitivity to valganciclovir/ganciclovir; ANC <500 mm3; 
platelets <25,000 mm3; hemoglobin <8 g/dL; and patients on hemodialysis. Use with 
caution in renal insufficiency (adjust dose; see Chapter 31), preexisting bone marrow 
suppression, or receiving myelosuppressive drugs or irradiation. Has not been evaluated in 
hepatic impairment. May cause headache, insomnia, peripheral neuropathy, diarrhea, 
vomiting, neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Neutropenia incidence is greater at 
day 200 versus day 100 in pediatric kidney transplant patients.
Use effective contraception during and for at least 90 days after therapy; may impair fertility in men 
and women. See Ganciclovir for drug interactions and additional adverse effects.
Monitor CBC with differential, platelets, and serum creatinine at baseline and periodically during 
therapy. Consider changes in serum creatinine and body changes to height and body weight for 
prophylaxis dosing.

Migraine prophylaxis:
Child (limited data): Start at 10–15 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ BID (max. initial dose: 250 mg/dose). If 
needed, increase dose over 4–6 wk to 40–45 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ BID up to a maximum of 1000 
mg/24 hr. Alternative dosing for child ≥12 yr is 250 mg PO BID (max. dose: 1000 mg/24 hr).
Adult: Start with 500 mg/24 hr ÷ PO BID. Dose may be gradually increased to a max. of 1000 mg/24 
hr ÷ PO BID. If using divalproex sodium extended-­release tablets, administer daily dose once daily.
Contraindicated in hepatic disease, pregnancy (for migraine indication), urea cycle disorders (e.g., 
OTC deficiency), mitochondrial disorders with mutations in DNA polymerase γ (e.g., Alpers-­
Huttenlocher syndrome), and children <2 yr suspected of the aforementioned mitochondrial 
disorder. May cause GI, liver, blood, and CNS toxicity; weight gain; transient alopecia; 
pancreatitis (potentially life-­threatening); nausea; sedation; vomiting; headache; 
thrombocytopenia (dose-­related); platelet dysfunction; rash (especially with lamotrigine); and 
hyperammonemia. Hepatic failure has occurred especially in children <2 yr (especially those 
receiving multiple anticonvulsants, with congenital metabolic disorders, with severe seizure 
disorders with mental retardation, and with organic brain disease). Idiosyncratic life-­threatening 
pancreatitis has been reported in children and adults. Hyperammonemic encephalopathy has 
been reported in patients with urea cycle disorders. Suicidal behavior or ideation, male infertility, 
elevated testosterone, decreased bone mineral density, DRESS, encephalopathy without elevated 
ammonia levels, hair texture/color changes, and nail/nail bed disorders have been reported.
Valproic acid is a substrate for CYP 450 2C19 isoenzyme and an inhibitor of CYP 450 2C9, 2D6 and 
3A3/4 (weak). It increases amitriptyline/nortriptyline, rufinamide, phenytoin, propofol, diazepam, 
and phenobarbital levels. Concomitant estrogen-­containing contraceptives, phenytoin, phenobar­
bital, topiramate, meropenem, cholestyramine, and carbamazepine may decrease valproic acid 
levels. Amitriptyline or nortriptyline may increase valproic acid levels. May interfere with urine 
ketone and thyroid tests.
Do not give syrup with carbonated beverages. Use of IV route has not been evaluated for >14 days of 
continuous use. Infuse IV over 1 hr up to a max. rate of 20 mg/min. Depakote and Depakote ER are 
NOT bioequivalent; see package insert for dose conversion.
Therapeutic levels: 50–100 mg/L. Recommendations for serum sampling at steady state: Obtain 
trough level within 30 min prior to the next scheduled dose after 2–3 days of continuous dosing. 
Levels of 50–60 mg/L and as high as 85 mg/L have been recommended for bipolar disorders. 
Monitor CBC and LFTs prior to and during therapy.
Valproic acid and divalproex should not be used in pregnant women. Increased risk of neural tube 
defects, decreased child IQ scores, craniofacial defects, and cardiovascular malformations have 
been reported in babies exposed to valproic acid and divalproex sodium.
Pregnancy category is “X” when used for migraine prophylaxis and is “D” for all other indications.

the following maximum doses:
<18 kg: 40 mg/24 hr
≥18 kg: 80 mg/24 hr
Child 6–16 yr: Start at 1.3 mg/kg/dose (max. dose: 40 mg) PO once daily. Dose may be increased up to 
the 2.7 mg/kg/dose up to 160 mg (whichever is lower); doses greater than this have not been studied.
Adolescent ≥17 yr and adult (non-­volume depleted status): Start 80 or 160 mg PO once daily; usual 
dose range is 80–320 mg once daily. Max. dose: 320 mg/24 hr.
Contraindicated with aliskiren use in diabetic patients. Discontinue use immediately after 
when pregnancy is detected. Use with caution in renal (CrCl <30 mL/min) and liver 
insufficiency, heart failure, post-­myocardial infarction, renal artery stenosis, renal function 
changes, and volume depletion.
Hypotension, dizziness, headache, cough, and increases in BUN and sCr are common side effects. 
Hyperkalemia (most commonly reported in children <6 yr with underlying renal disease in clinical trials; 
also consider salt substitutes, foods, and medications which may increase potassium levels), bullous 
dermatitis, angioedema, acute renal failure, and dysgeusia have been reported. May increase lithium 
levels resulting in toxicity for those receiving concurrent lithium therapy; monitor lithium levels closely.
Onset of initial antihypertensive effects is 2 hr with maximum effects after 2–4 wk of chronic use. 
Patients may require higher doses of oral tablet dosage form than with the oral suspension due to 
increased bioavailability with the oral suspension.

Child and adult: Same dose as moderate-­risk patients plus gentamicin 1.5 mg/kg/dose (max. 
dose: 120 mg/dose) IV/IM ×1
Ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity may occur and may be exacerbated with concurrent 
aminoglycoside use. Greater nephrotoxicity risk has been associated with higher 
therapeutic serum trough concentrations (≥15 mg/mL), concurrent piperacillin/tazobactam 
therapy, and receiving furosemide in the intensive care unit. Adjust dose in renal failure 
(see Chapter 31). Use total body weight for obese patients when calculating dosages. Low 
concentrations of the drug may appear in CSF with inflamed meninges. Nausea, vomiting, 
and drug-­induced erythroderma are common with IV use. “Red man syndrome” associated 
with rapid IV infusion may occur. Infuse over 60 min (may infuse over 120 min if 60-­min 
infusion is not tolerated). NOTE: Diphenhydramine is used to reverse red man syndrome. 
Allergic reactions (including drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms [DRESS]), 
neutropenia, and immune-­mediated thrombocytopenia have been reported.
Although current extrapolated adult guidelines suggest measuring only trough levels, an additional 
post-­distributional level may be useful in characterizing enhanced/altered drug clearance for 
quicker dosage modification to attain target levels; this may be useful for infants with known 
faster clearance and patients in renal compromise. Consult a pharmacist.
The following therapeutic trough level recommendations are based on the assumption that the 
pathogen’s Vancomycin MIC is ≤ 1 mg/L.

Recommended serum sampling time at steady state: Trough within 30 min prior to the 
fourth consecutive dose and peak 60 min after the administration of the fourth consecutive 
dose. Infants with faster elimination (shorter T1/2) may be sampled around the third ­consecutive 
dose.
Recent evidence strongly suggests moving away from serum trough vancomycin monitoring to 
a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) target of area under the curve (AUC) to MIC 
ratio. An AUC{24} of 400–600 mg*h/L is associated with clinical efficacy and reduced risk 
for AKI. Vancomycin therapeutic monitoring guidelines are currently being revised by the 
IDSA in collaboration with PIDS, SIDP, and ASHP and are forthcoming. Consult with an ID 
specialist and pharmacist to see how best this monitoring method is operationalized at your 
institution.
ORAL USE for C. difficile: Vancomycin (PO) or metronidazole (PO) are currently the recommended 
first-­line therapy for children, whereas vancomycin (PO) or fidaxomicin is recommended for adults. 
See Clinical Infectious Diseases 66(7):e1–e48 for the 2017 IDSA/SHEA Clinical Practice Guidelines. 
Common adverse effects with oral vancomycin capsules in adults include nausea, abdominal pain, 
and hypokalemia.

Use with caution in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, and neuromuscular disease. 
Dose reduction may be necessary in hepatic insufficiency. Infants (7 wk to 1 yr) are more 
sensitive to the drug and may have a longer recovery time. Children (1–10 yr) may require 
higher doses and more frequent supplementation than adults. Enflurane, isoflurane, 
aminoglycosides, β-­blockers, calcium channel blockers, clindamycin, furosemide, 
magnesium salts, quinidine, procainamide, and cyclosporine may increase the potency and

No longer recommended as an antihypertensive agent for children. Contraindications include 
hypersensitivity, cardiogenic shock, severe CHF, sick sinus syndrome, or AV block. Use with 
caution in hepatic and renal (reduce dose in renal insufficiency; see Chapter 31) 
impairment. Owing to negative inotropic effects, verapamil should not be used to treat 
SVT in an emergency setting in infants. Avoid IV use in neonates and young infants due 
to apnea, bradycardia and hypotension. May cause constipation, headache, dizziness, 
edema, and hypotension. EPS has been reported.
Monitor ECG. Have calcium and isoproterenol available to reverse myocardial depression. May 
decrease neuromuscular transmission in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and worsen 
myasthenia gravis.

US RDA: See Chapter 21.
Supplementation in measles (a third dose may be administered 2–4 wk after the second 
dose if patient has ocular signs of vitamin A deficiency or is severely malnourished; see 
remarks):
<6 mo: 50,000 IU/dose once daily PO × 2 days.
Infant 6 mo to <1 yr: 100,000 IU/dose once daily PO × 2 days.
Child 1–5 yr: 200,000 IU/dose once daily PO × 2 days.
Malabsorption syndrome prophylaxis:
Child >8 yr and adult: 10,000–50,000 IU/dose once daily PO of water miscible product.
Cystic fibrosis (usually dosed in cystic fibrosis specific multi-­vitamins; monitor serum 
concentrations):
Infant: 1,500 IU/dose once daily PO
Child 1–3 yr: 5,000 IU/dose once daily PO
Child 4–8 yr: 5,000–10,000 IU/dose once daily PO
Child ≥9 yr and adolescent: 10,000 IU/dose once daily PO
High doses above the U.S. RDA are teratogenic (category X). The use of vitamin A in 
measles is recommended in children 6 mo–2 yr of age who are either hospitalized or who 
have any of the following risk factors: immunodeficiency, ophthalmologic evidence of 
vitamin A deficiency, impaired GI absorption, moderate to severe malnutrition, and recent 
immigration from areas with high measles mortality. May cause GI disturbance, rash, 
headache, increased ICP (pseudotumor cerebri), papilledema, and irritability. Large doses 
may increase the effects of warfarin. Mineral oil, cholestyramine and neomycin will reduce 
vitamin A absorption. Do not access vitamin A levels during an acute inflammatory 
condition as falsely low levels have been reported.

Currently approved for use in invasive aspergillosis; candidemia and disseminated candidiasis in 
skin, abdomen, kidney, bladder wall, and wounds; candidal esophagitis; and serious infections 
caused by Fusarium species and Scedosporium apiospermum in children ≥2 yr of age.
Common side effects include GI disturbances, fever, headache, hepatic abnormalities, photosensitiv­
ity (higher incidence in children; avoid direct sunlight and use protective measures), rash (6%), 
and visual disturbances (30%). Serious but rare side effects include anaphylaxis, liver or renal 
failure, and Stevens-­Johnsons syndrome. Pancreatitis has been reported in children. Monitor 
serum transaminase and bilirubin levels weekly for the first month of therapy followed by reduced 
frequency has been recommended. Higher frequency of LFT elevations has reported with children. 
Dermatological follow up is recommended for those who develop photosensitivity reactions as 
squamous cell carcinoma has been reported in those who experience this adverse reaction.
Correct potassium, magnesium, and calcium levels before and during voriconazole therapy. Adjust 
dose in hepatic impairment by decreasing only the maintenance dose by 50% for patients with 
a Child-­Pugh Class A or B. Do not use IV dosage form for patients with GFR <50 mL/min because 
of accumulation of the cyclodextrin excipient; switch to oral therapy if possible. Patients receiving 
concurrent phenytoin should increase their voriconazole maintenance doses (IV: 5 mg/kg/dose Q 12 
hr; PO: double the usual dose).
Inter-­occasion pharmacokinetic variability is high, thus requiring serum level monitoring. Therapeutic 
levels: trough: 1–5.5 mg/L. Levels <1 mg/L have resulted in treatment failures and levels >5.5 
mg/L have resulted in neurotoxicity such as encephalopathy. Recommended serum sampling time: 
obtain trough within 30 min prior to a dose. Steady state is typically achieved after 5–7 days of 
initiating therapy.
Oral bioequivalence of the oral suspension and tablet has not been evaluated in children. Administer 
IV over 1–2 hr with a max. rate of 3 mg/kg/hr at a concentration ≤ 5 mg/mL. Administer oral doses 
1 hr before and after meals.

Use with caution in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. Dosage reduction is 
recommended in severe renal impairment and may be necessary in hepatic dysfunction. Drug 
penetrates well into the CNS. Most common side effects include: anemia, granulocytopenia, nausea, 
and headache (dosage reduction, erythropoietin, filgrastim/GCSF, or discontinuance may be required 
depending on event). Seizures, confusion, rash, myositis, myopathy (use > 1 yr), hepatitis, and 
elevated liver enzymes have been reported. Macrocytosis is noted after 4 wk of therapy and can be 
used as an indicator of compliance. Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including 
fatal cases, have been reported. Neutropenia and severe anemia have been reported in advanced HIV 
disease. Use of injectable dosage form may cause allergic reactions in latex-­sensitive individuals.

For supplementation in parenteral nutrition, see Chapter 21.
Nausea, vomiting, GI disturbances, leukopenia, and diaphoresis may occur. Gastric ulcers, 
hypotension, and tachycardia may occur at high doses. Patients with excessive losses 
(burns) or impaired absorption require higher doses. Therapeutic levels: 70–130 mCg/dL.
Parenteral products may contain aluminum; use with caution in renal impairment. May decrease 
the absorption of penicillamine, tetracycline, and fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin). Drugs that 
increase gastric pH (e.g., H2 antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) can reduce the absorption of 
zinc. Excessive zinc administration can cause copper deficiency.
Approximately 20%–30% of oral dose is absorbed. Oral doses may be administered with food if GI 
upset occurs. Pregnancy category is “A” for zinc acetate and “C” for all other salt forms.

Nasal (safety of an average of > 4 headaches in a 30-­day period has not been established; 
see remarks):
≥ 12 yr and adult: Start with 2.5 mg inhaled into a single nostril × 1. If needed in 2 hr, a second 
dose may be administered. Dose may be increased to a maximum single dose of 5 mg if needed. 
Max. daily dose: 10 mg/24 hr.
Patients receiving concurrent cimetidine: Limit maximum doses to 2.5 mg as the max. single 
dose and do not exceed 5 mg in any 24 hr period.
Oral (Safety and efficacy in children have not been established with the oral route. One randomized 
placebo-­controlled trial in 696 adolescents 12–17 yr old did not establish efficacy and had 
similar adverse events as seen in adult trials):
Adult (Safety of an average of > 3 headaches in a 30-­day period has not been established; see 
remarks):
PO tabs: Start with 1.25–2.5 mg PO × 1. If needed in 2 hr, a second dose may be administered. Dose 
may be increased to a maximum single dose of 5 mg if needed. Max. daily dose: 10 mg/24 hr.
ODT tabs: Use the same dosage recommendation for PO tabs but with a 2.5 mg initial dose.
Patients receiving concurrent cimetidine: Limit maximum doses to 2.5 mg as the max. single 
dose and do not exceed 5 mg in any 24 hr period for both PO and ODT tabs.
Contraindicated in ischemic bowel disease; ischemic coronary artery disease; uncontrolled 
hypertension; peripheral vascular disease; history of stroke or TIA, arrhythmias, hemiplegic, 
or basilar migraine; significant cardiovascular disease; and coronary artery vasospasm.
Do not administer with any ergot-containing medications, any other 5-­HT1 agonist (e.g., triptans), 
methylene blue, or within 2 wk of discontinuing a MAO inhibitor or linezolid. Cimetidine may 
increase the zolmitriptan levels; see dosage section for reduced maximum dosage. Patients with 
multiple cardiovascular risk factors and negative cardiovascular evaluation should have their first 
dose administered in a medically supervised facility.
Use not recommended in moderate/severe hepatic impairment. Severe renal impairment (CrCl 5–25 
mL/min) reduces zolmitriptan clearance by 25%.
Common adverse reactions for all dosage forms unless otherwise indicated include nausea, taste 
alteration (nasal route), xerostomia, dizziness, hyperesthesia (nasal route), paresthesia, somno­
lence, sensation of hot and cold, throat pain, and asthenia (oral route). Hypertension, coronary 
artery spasm, MI, cerebral hemorrhage, and headaches have been reported.
For intranasal use, blow nose gently prior to dosing. Block opposite nostril while administering dose 
by breathing in gently.
When using the ODT, place the whole tablet on the tongue, allow the tablet to dissolve, and swallow 
with saliva. Administration with liquids is optional. Do not break the ODT tablet.

Recommended higher alternative dosing: Start with 2–4 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ BID–TID. Gradually 
increase dosage PRN at 2-­wk intervals to 4–8 mg/kg/24 hr; max. dose: 12 mg/kg/24 hr.
Infantile spasms (regimen that was effective in a small study from Japan; additional studies 
needed): Start with 2–4 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ BID. Then increase by 2–5 mg/kg/24 hr every 2–4 day 
until seizures disappear, up to a maximum of 20 mg/kg/24 hr.
> 16 yr–adult:
Adjunctive therapy for partial seizures: 100 mg PO once daily × 2 wk. Dose may be increased to 
200 mg PO once daily × 2 wk. Additional dosage increments of 100 mg/24 hr can be made at 2-­wk 
intervals to allow attainment of steady-­state levels. Effective doses have ranged from 100–600 
mg/24 hr ÷ once daily–BID (BID dosing may provide better efficacy). No additional benefit has 
been shown for doses > 400 mg/24 hr.
Because zonisamide is a sulfonamide, it is contraindicated in patients allergic to 
sulfonamides (may result in Stevens-­Johnson syndrome or TEN). Common side effects of 
drowsiness, ataxia, anorexia, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, rash, and pruritis 
usually occur early in therapy and can be minimized with slow dose titration. Children are 
at increased risk for hyperthermia and oligohydrosis, especially in warm or hot weather. 
Suicidal behavior or ideation, acute pancreatitis, urolithiasis, metabolic acidosis (more 
frequent and severe in younger patients), DRESS/multi-­organ hypersensitivity, 
rhabdomyolysis, and elevated creatinine phosphokinase have been reported.
Although not fully delineated, therapeutic serum levels of 20–30 mg/L have been suggested as 
higher rates of adverse reactions have been seen at levels > 30 mg/L.
Zonisamide is a CYP 450 3A4 substrate. Phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital can decrease 
levels of zonisamide.
Use with caution in renal or hepatic impairment; slower dose titration and more frequent monitoring 
is recommended. Do not use if GFR is <50 mL/min. Avoid abrupt discontinuation or radical dose 
reductions. Swallow capsules whole and do not crush or chew.

I.  DOSE ADJUSTMENT METHODS
A.  Maintenance Dose
In patients with renal insufficiency, the dose may be adjusted using the 
following methods:
	1.	 Interval extension (I): Lengthen intervals between individual doses, 
keeping dose size normal. For this method, a suggested interval is 
shown.
	2.	 Dose reduction (D): Reduce number of individual doses, keeping interval 
between doses normal; recommended when relatively constant blood 
level of drug is desired. For this method, percentage of usual dose 
is shown. For some medications and indications, specific dosing is 
provided.
	3.	 Interval extension and dose reduction (DI): Both lengthen interval and 
reduce dose.
	4.	 Interval extension or dose reduction (D, I): In some instances, either 
dose or interval can be changed.
NOTE: These dose adjustment methods do not apply to patients in the neo-
natal period. For neonatal renal dosing, please consult a neonatal dosage 
reference (see Chapter 18). Dose modifications given are only approxima-
tions and may not be appropriate for all patients or indications. Each patient 
must be monitored closely for signs of drug toxicity, and serum levels must 
be measured when available; drug doses and intervals should be adjusted 
accordingly. When in doubt, always consult a nephrologist or pharmacist 
who has expertise in renal dosing. 
B.  Dialysis
General recommendations are provided when available. However, factors 
such as patient age, indication for use, residual native kidney function, 
specific peritoneal dialysis (PD) or intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) settings, 
etc., will affect the medication dosing needs of each individual patient. 
Consult with a nephrologist or pharmacist who is familiar with medication 
dosing in dialysis prior to prescribing medications for a dialysis patient.

Valganciclovir
Note: For dosing in children, a 
maximum eGFR value of 150 
mL/min/1.73 m2 should be 
used to calculate the dose. 
Calculate eGFR using modified 
Schwartz formula where k 
= 0.33 in infants aged <1 
year, with low birth weight for 
gestational age, 0.45 in infants 
aged <1 year, with birth weight 
appropriate for gestational 
age, 0.45 in children aged 1 to 
<2 years, 0.55 in boys aged 2 
to <13 years and girls aged 2 
to <16 years, and 0.7 in boys 
aged 13–16 years. Consider

to allow for redistribution from peripheral 
compartment. If patient is unstable, may obtain 
sooner with knowledge that concentration may 
be lower than steady state.
